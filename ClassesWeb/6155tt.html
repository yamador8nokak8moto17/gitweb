<p> A completed project consists of two things.  The first is a paper of
about 10 pages typeset, which discusses the mathematics you've learned.
It should include references, definitions, statements of theorems,
motivation, lots of examples, and proofs where appropriate.  Try to
assimilate what you read in different sources, and generate your own
examples.  The paper need not be original research, but it should be
your own work when you're done.  In mathematics, it's not necessary to
footnote every detail, but your bibliography should include every source
you use, as well as some you might have read and not used.  </p>

<p> The second is a 50-minute presentation to the other members of the class.
This will probably overlap some with your paper, but oral presentation
is a different skill from written.  Choosing good examples and
motivating the definitions and theorems is even more important here.
You won't have time to prove everything, but you need to at least
"induce a benevolent feeling of credulity" (in the words of Paul Halmos)
in the audience.  </p>

<p> Please accomplish the following task by the date listed.  I will try
to give you lots of helpful feedback to make your presentations and
papers excellent.  Please ask me for help whenever you need it.  </p>

<p> Grading: The primary criterion will be the clarity of the
exposition.  The paper and the presentation count equally.  Please
proofread carefully, since errors in punctuation and grammaer, ambiguous
statements, and incorrect formulas can be very confusing. </p>

<ul>
<li> (Thu. 28 Jan.) Pick a topic and meet with me to get it approved.
<li> (Thu. 16  Feb.) Turn in an outline of what you might present.
<li> (Feb. 22-26) Meet with me outside class for a practice
presentation.
<li> (Tue.  2 Mar.) Turn in a draft of the paper, and a cassette tape
for my comments.   
<li> (Tue. 16 Mar.) Turn in final version of paper.
