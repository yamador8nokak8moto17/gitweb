<h2>Class Information</h2>


<p class="mathpar"><i> COORDINATES:  </i>  This class is hybrid, but mostly online, synchronous over Zoom.  
Classes meet Tues/Thurs 11:00&ndash;12:15 over Zoom.  (The link is in HuskyCT.) 
Please come to class
 ready to engage with the material.  There is also a Zulip discussion board (see below), which is
  the best place outside of class to ask questions.  

<!--  A link will be sent by email and  available in HuskyCT to registered students.   -->

<p><i> PREREQUISITES:</i> Math 2710 (Transition to Higher Math)</p>

<p> <i> TEXT:</i> We will be loosely following the text <a href="https://alozano.clas.uconn.edu/number-theory-and-geometry/
">Number Theory and Geometry</a> by our
  own <a href="https://alozano.clas.uconn.edu/">Alvaro Lozano-Robledo</a>, which he has made freely available. We will
  also use some of the <a href="https://kconrad.math.uconn.edu/blurbs/">short expository blurbs on number theory</a>
  written by our own <a href="https://kconrad.math.uconn.edu/">Keith Conrad</a>.  

<p><i> WEB RESOURCES:</i> The homepage for this course will be available
and updated at  <a href="http://www.math.uconn.edu/~troby/math3240f23">
http://www.math.uconn.edu/~troby/math3240f23</a>. 
 </p>

<p><i>HuskyCT:</i> We will make use the HuskyCT LMS, supplemented with tools that work better.  
A copy of the course schedule will be posted there that includes links to
worksheets, HW exercises, and some solutions (which are for your personal use only, not to be
shared). You will turn in worksheets and homework assignments in Gradescope via Husky CT.  
For classroom discussions, we will use Zulip (see below).
</p>

<p><i> GRADING:</i>  Your grade will be based on a single midterm exams, a final
exam, worksheets, homework and participation. </p>

The breakdown of points is:<br> <br>

<center>
<TABLE BORDER="4" CELLPADDING="2">
<tr><th> Midterm <th> Final <th>  Worksheets  <th> Homework <th> Participation </tr>
<tr><th>30% <th>40% <th>10% <th> 10% <th> 10% </tr>
</TABLE>
</center>
<p></p>

 <p class="mathpar"><i> EXAMS: </i> The midterm date is <b>already scheduled for 26 October (Thursday)</b>, so please mark your calendars 
now.  The final exam is scheduled by the registrar around mid-semester. 
 All exams (like math itself at this level) are cumulative. No
makeups will be given; instead if you have an approved reason for missing a midterm, your other exams
will count for the appropriately higher percentage. 
If you miss the final for reasons <b>approved by the Dean of Students</b> and <b>you have completed at least 2/3 of the
assignments,</b> then you will have one chance to take a
make-up final exam in the second or third week of the following term.
I reserve the right to give a followup oral exam to verify your understanding if there are any questions about academic
integrity</p> 

 <!--  <p class="mathpar"><i> QUIZZES: </i> Quizzes will be given each Thursday (except midterm -->
 <!--  exam days), covering (a) sections from the previous week (at the level of HW exercises). -->
 <!--  There are no makeup quizzes; however, your -->
 <!--  lowest two quiz scores will be dropped. Here is a -->
 <!--  sample <a href="~troby/math3240f19/Handouts/pq1.pdf">Practice Quiz</a> so you know ahead -->
 <!--  of time what the format will be. (Solutions will be provided below.) </p> -->


<p><i>STUDENT WORKFLOW:</i> For each class you should:

<ol>
<li> Read the recommended sources, or find better ones on the web.  
<li> Complete the <b>WORKSHEET PROBLEMS</b> and SUBMIT them by the deadline (FRIDAY at NOON).   
<li> USE the <b>ZULIP</b> DISCUSSION BOARD or <b>CLASS SESSIONS</b> anytime you get seriously stuck;
<li> CHECK your WORKSHEET against the <b>SOLUTIONS</b> (posted the morning after the due date);
<li> READ the <b>TEXTBOOK</b> to fill in gaps, see an alternate presentation, straighten out
confusing points; 
<li> DO as many <b>HOMEWORK</b> problems as you can.  
them by 11:59PM WEDNESDAY of the following week. 
<li> CHECK your HW against the solutions (posted the morning after the due date);
</ol>

<!--  <p> This course will be <b>fast-paced</b> and cover quite a bit of material.   -->
<!--  I strongly encourage you to <b>work ahead  -->
<!--  whenever possible</b>, since you never know when circumstances beyond your control may conspire -->
<!--  to set you behind.  The video lectures for the entire semester are already available.</p> -->

<p> <i>DISCUSSION BOARDS:</i> The Zulip discussion board allows you to ask questions and interact with
one another (and the instructor) between class meetings.  
The quality and quantity of
your posts count towards your participation grade.  If you don't have questions,
please try to help out your fellow students who might be confused, or post asummary of the video lecture. </p> 

<p> <i>PARTICIPATION:</i> Class participation, discussion posts, and completing course surveys
all count towards your participation grade.  This includes keeping your webcam on so that
  you are visible during online sessions, except for brief periods where you have an important reason for turning it off. (If you
  have a special situation around this, please check with me privately.) </p>

<p> <i>WORKSHEETS:</i> Every week has a worksheet of basic problems, which you will be
working on during classtime and afterwards  Worksheets are due by NOON Friday on Gradescope. 
These will be graded for completion rather than accuracy.  
</p>

<p> <i>GRADESCOPE:</i> You will turn in your completed worksheets, HW, and even midterm exams using the Gradescope tool
  that is integrated into HuskyCT.  If you click on an assignment there, it will take you to Gradescope.  It greatly
  facilitates my ability to grade exams and give you feedback.  Please upload every file as a <b>clear (easily readable)
  pdf scan</b>, and be careful that you are not casting a shadow over you work if you use your phone to take a picture. </p>

<p> <i>HOMEWORK:</i> Will be assigned for each week, and is due in HuskyCT/Gradescope by 11:59PM WEDNESDAY of the following week.

<p> You may find some homework problems to be
challenging, leading you to spend lots of time working on them and
sometimes get frustrated.  This is natural.  I encourage you to work
with other people in person or electronically.  It's OK to get
significant help from any resource, but in the end, please write your
own solution in your own words.  <b>Copying someone else's work
without credit is plagiarism and will be dealt with according
to <a href="http://community.uconn.edu/the-student-code-appendix-a/">university
policy</a>.</b> Equally importantly, it is a poor learning strategy.

 <p><i> LATE/UNREADABLE ASSIGNMENTS:</i> Late homework and worksheets (up to 48 hours beyond the 2-hour grace
period) will receive half credit, after that none.  Homework and worksheets that are not easily readable
(e.g., because of bad photo quality) will not be graded and will not receive credit. Various smartphone
scanning apps can help produce very readable PDF images of your work. </p>



<p><i>SOFTWARE</i>  In trying to understand properties of integers, we
  will often want to generate some data.  Doing some computations by
  hand is generally good for learning, but having software that can do
  bigger computations or check your works is very useful.  One free
  source on the web
  is <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/">WolframAlpha</a>.  For a
  full-fledged progamming environment, check out the free open-source
  computer algebra system 
  called <a href="http://www.sagemath.org">Sage</a>.  

<p><i> ACADEMIC INTEGRITY:</i>  Please make sure you
  are familiar with and abide by
<a  href="http://community.uconn.edu/the-student-code-appendix-a/">The
  Student Code governing Academic Integrity in Undergraduate Education
  and Research.</a>  For exams you may not discuss the
  material with anyone other than the instructor or offical proctor, and
  no calculators, phones, slide rules or other devices designed to aid
  communication or computation may be used unless otherwise specifically
  indicated on the exam.    
</p>

<p><i> CONTENT:</i> Number Theory is a fascinating
  subject.  It's richness and beauty has captured the imagination of the
  greatest mathematicians from antiquity to the current day.  Once
  thought to be some of the purest (read "most useless") branch of
  mathematics, it is now one of the most important: Many of the most
  important cryptographic systems, including some crucial to everyday
  web commerce, are based on deep unsolved problems in number theory.</p>

<p><i> APPLICATIONS:</i> Number theory used to be considered one of the purest subjects in pure mathematics.  One
  prominent mathematician even proudly declared it to be "useless", (by which he meant without applications to
  warfare). But these days most important cryptography is based in number theory, so the subject is crucial both to
  national defense and e-commerce.  The system that protects your passwords and credit-card information on a secure
  website is usually based these days on RSA encryption, which we will cover in the first half of this course.  
</p>

<p> <i>ACCESSIBILITY &  DISABILITY ISSUES:</i> Please
  contact me and UConn's <a href="http://www.csd.uconn.edu/">Center for
  Students with Disabilities</a> <b>as soon as possible (BUT NO LATER THAN END OF WEEK 2)</b> if you have any
  accessibility issues, have a (documented) disability and wish to
  discuss academic accommodations, or if you would need assistance in
  the event of an emergency. <b>In particular, CSD wants a great deal of lead time for scheduling exams</b>.</p>

<p><i> LEARNING:</i> <b> The only way to learn
mathematics is by doing it! </b> Complete each assignment to the best of
your ability, and get help when you are confused.  Take advantage of the online discussions
and office hours and the wealth of information on the web.   </p>
