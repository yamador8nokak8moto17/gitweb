-------(4) Any other comments or suggestions?  (Feel free to use the back.)--------

**    Post annotated notes (one says: could be after quizzes, but before exams)
*    Prof. Roby's enthusiasm is contagious!
*    Hwk is overall good but some questions seem irrelevant and complicated
*    This has been my favorite math course in a long time
*    I dislike the textbook because it withholds some of the answers
*    please give us an easy midterm
*    I greatly enjoy the course currently
*    Sometimes you rush because you want to reach the last section that most profs don't get to
*    Sometimes I can't understand handwriting or you use symbols I don't recognize
*    For fun you could use ASL instead of TFRM cards
*    I like that the slides have blanks, it makes it easier to stay focused
*    I have a hard time with the theoretical side of math
*    I like this class, I feel that you have it set up for us to do well if we do our part
*    Make the "clicker" questions available to study from
*    I love the sock selection
*    Overall good class, the teacher outlook to helping students is what a teacher is supposed to do
