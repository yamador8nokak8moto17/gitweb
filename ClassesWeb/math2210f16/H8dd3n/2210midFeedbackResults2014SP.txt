-----(1) List some things you like about the course (if any).--------

2    Quizzes
	* I like how there are weekly quizzes so I don't have to cram as much for exams
	* Quizzes + Extra points
4    Pace
	* The pace is very good.
	* The pace at which the material is being taught.
	* The lecture is very well-paced.
16    Lectures/Use of technology for lectures
        * Everything is explained well during lectures.  All questions are answered very thoroughly.
	* I like following the slides
	* I like that lectures follow handouts which you fill in during class. 
	* Lecture notes 
	* I really like the printed notes, they take a lot of pressure away from me and allow me to listen more.
	* I like the print-out notes that outline class and how descriptive the syllabus is with weeks color coded.
	* Printed lecture slides
	* in-depth lectures
	* Notes online are good
	* The projector/presentation teaching style
	* I like the process of learning with the mixture of lecture notes and chalkboard.
	* Use of colors in lecture notes.  Notes can be printed out for class.
	* I like that we have print-outs of the notes.  It makes it a lot easier to follow along and to clarify questions.  
	* I like the way notes are set up, it's different than a lot of other classes
	and involves more than just copying lecture slides. 
7    The video lecture
	* I liked the video lecture.  I could pause, rewind, and have the information for a while.
	* Utilizing the video lecture was a good idea because it allowed the class to not fall behind in the material.
	* Video lecture was good just to have and to make sure we don't go behind schedule.
	* Video lectures are short.
8    Professor
	* I enjoy your teaching style!  I like your enthusiasm.
	* I like the fact that, unlike a lot of teachers who just skip the lecture in
	general on a snow day, you took the initiative to create a video lecture for us. 
	* The professor seems to care about us and is nice.
	* Occasionally witty jokes are involved...I enjoy the so I'm all for more puns etc...
	* Instructor style
	* The instructor isn't boring, which helps a lot.
	* Good teacher
	* Professor effectively keeps students interested.
1    Class atmosphere
     	* I like the feeling of the class (i.e. comfortable setting)
5    TFRM cards
        * I like how cards are used to get the class's understanding.
	* Course feedback / use of TFRM cards
	* The T/F cards are also a good touch.
2    Structure of class
     	* Organized, interesting, entertaining
	* The homework followed by the quiz is very helpful because it insures that I
	have to go to every class and it makes me make sure I'm on top of all the material. 
1    Textbook is good as well
1    Content
        * It applies to my Robotics course and I can see instant connections between what we're learning in both classes.
2    Website
        * The notes on the material located on the class website.
3    Homework
        * I like how homeworks help aid with understanding a section before a quiz.
	* The homework assignments (True & False)
2    Homework review
        * Reviewing homework questions
2    Quizzes
        * Quizzes are good for studying.
	* I like having weekly quizzes because then I can see how well I have retained the previous weeks information.
1    Color of socks
        * I'm sure the instructor's socks are nice too.
1    Other
	* It's the 3rd class of the day and is kinda easy.
	* I really like everything!  You care that everyone is on the same page.
	Your use of the computer notes & the note writing projector thing is *great*.
	I hate my notes usually because they aren't concise.  It's very helpful to be
	able to print them out.  Homework is very doable.  Theory is sometimes hard
	but that's just the material.  Quizzes are fair. 
	* The "democratic self-improvement system"
	

-------(2) List some areas where you feel the course could be improved (if any).-------

3    Nothing
        * Can't think of any
2    Chalkboard
        * I have a hard time reading the chalkboard
	* Write harder on the blackboard (sometimes too faint)
6    Homework
	* Sometimes homework questions are redundant when there's a lot assigned, but
	  I guess practice is the best way to learn. 
	* Too many homework problems
	* Most of the HW is terrible and doesn't help.
	* I think there could be a cut down on the number of homework problems per week.
	* HW assignment length...takes a really long time to do properly.  Could you
	  possible give HW a higher percentage?  or shorten? 
	* Way too many homework problems.
1    Homework solutions
        * I think the course could be improved if HW solutions were posted online after an assignment is due.
2    Less time spent on homework in class
        * I feel the course could be improved if less time was spent on the homework
	an dmore of the time was used for the lesson and additional exampes that
	aren't in the lesson print-outs. 
	* I like the HW reviews but it seems like we end up doing almost all of th
	equestions which leaves us less time for th electure.  I like the idea of
	lecture first with a fixed amount of time for hw questions at the end of class. 
1    More time spent on homework during class
        * Go over all homework
1    Time management
        * Time management of classes
4    Lecture notes
        * Power Points are great, but filling in blanks does not ingrave things into my mind as much as writing coherent thoughts.  I think I may not use the power point slides, or write notes on the side that are images of the regular notes.
	* Put the annotated notes online.  (The blanks can be confusing.)
	* Maybe the notes could include a little more in terms of explanations to
	supplement the definitions to help us better understand the theory behind it
	all, but it can be found in the book so this is minor. 
	* The notes that you use on screen are slightly different from ours version.
	* I don't have enough time to copy the note after you finish a part and click
	on next page at once if I try to keep understanding while you are teaching. 
8    Pace
        * Class goes by slowly, though this is understandable since others learn at different paces.
	* Some sections get rushed and I feel like I have to teach myself
	* Sometimes you rush through the lectures.  I understand the cancellations have put us behind though.
	* Sometimes, I have a hard time keeping up with the lecture because it is on
	the projector.  I learn the material better when it is written on the board. 
	* Rushing through lectures to stay on track with syllabus.
	* Can't really think of anything right now.  If anything, do pace checks more
	often because some students around me were talking about how they were 	confused. 
	* Maybe a little faster but a slower course isn't the end of the world.
	* I feel like sometimes the course drags very slowly and then other days, the
	  lecture is extremely rushed.  I would be a lot happier with a happy medium. 
1    Textbook
        * I have trouble trying to understand what the book wants.
1    TFRM cards
        * There is a lot of emphasis on true and false questions, I know my stuff but they just have a way of tripping me up.
1    Other
	* LU Factorization...?
	* I got nothin...Maybe some solutions to problems for studying?  Although
	 google works just as good so its not really necessary. 



-------(3) List some things you could do to improve your experience--------

     Nothing
        * I believe that they way the class is current going so far this semester, is
     	good therefore I can't really think of anything that could improve my experience
     	in this course. 
2    Print out slides to follow along
     Review the slides more
2    Review lecture notes before/after lecture
        * I could go over the notes a second time myself while going along in the
     	book and adding more of my own comments to them. 
3    Read the book
        * Read the theorems and highlights in the book
        * I haven't been reading the sections.  Reading is usually not necessary but
     	would probably help me fully grasp the sections.  They're starting to get more
     	complicated as my work load goes up.  Ah! 
	* Read chapters more thoroughly
3    Spend more time studying
        * I can spend more time to using resources other than our notes an dthe book
     	  to minimize homework-question time in class. 
        * Study for quizzes better by going over definitions and theorems.
     	I could study with other students outside the classroom for quizzes.
2    	Do assignments earlier
        * Do homework earlier/not procrastinate.  I always end up staying up really
     	  late Monday night / Tuesday morning to finish the homework. 
     Actually care about linear algebra / put in more effort
     Go over ways that questions can be asked
     Use my phone less.  It's not that th electures are boring but the allure of technology is strong.
     I think you're flying compared to every other linear class so I'm happy.  Going over homework also really helps.
     Perhaps I can communicate more when I feel as though the lectures are going by too quickly.
     Limit questions on hw the next day to 5 or so in order to get through material.
     [[Ed: I think this really was a comment the student was directing to
     him/herself, not to the instructor.]] 
     React faster to TFRM cards, it takes me too much time to think out.
     All seems to be good
     Pay more attention to the concepts after class is over.
     N/A
     I can't think of any.  The course is well-designed and could be one of my best in class experience in UConn so far.

     Review
        * A review before midterms and finals.  (optional review).  Review material
     such as at least 2 previous tests with answers.  [Ed: I think they misread the
     question.] 


-------(4) Any other comments or suggestions?  (Feel free to use the back.)--------


     * Everything I didn't mention explicitly (technology, quizzes, video lecture,
       etc.) is great as it is.  Overall I enjoy your teaching style and find it to
       be effective. 
     * None
     * I like your sense of humor!
     * I enjoy the class; I feel the pace is just right
     * I like doing examples more in class
     * Sometimes the proofs or true/false questions are deceiving and difficult for
       me to reason one way or another - maybe we can do more of those? 
     * Thanks for being concerned for your students!!!
     * Video lecture for the snow day was a good alternative.
     * Simplify the cards to just True and False
     * Good job so far
     * Get through notes before going over homework
     * Most of the HW isn't relevant, so cut down on that.  Also, class is stupid boring.
     * I hope the exam doesn't make me sad!
     * Explanations are good.
     * Nope.
     * You teach well, its a lot to take in but it's doable.
     * I enjoyed the video lectures for when we can't meet during class time.  And you have a great sense of humor.  :-)
     * I am learning a lot, thank you.
     * Nope, nothing.  I like this class.  :-)
     * N/A
     * You seem to be handling everything great.  Answering people's questions,
       handlig everyone's problems, adapting to the classes' needs and wants.  Great
       job. 
     * The most recent lectures using the blackboard were nice.  Much easier to read than the writing on the computer.
     * Reduce the number of homework problems when there are more than 2 sections of homework due.
     * I like that we have the notes to follow along, good idea!
     * The video lecture was a good idea and a good way to make up for lost time.  I
       enjoy the way the class is set up + taught over all. 
     * No
