<h3>Class Information</h3>

<p><i> LEARNING GOALS: </i> This course has an importance that goes
beyond the content.  Most students, even some math majors, think of
mathematics as learning procedures and practicing them.  It's easy for
teachers and students to fall into this habit.  Instead I want all
students to develop the mathematical habits of thought that are
necessary for doing and teaching mathematics.  Specifically:

<ul>
<li> Learn to experiment with examples, make conjectures, construct rigorous
 proofs and disproofs.  

<li> Learn to persevere on hard problems and use resources (books,
  internet, colleagues) effectively.  

<li>  Experience mathematics as a dynamic human activity, rather than a set
  of unwavering recipes handed down on stone tablets.
</ul>

<p><i> CONTENT GOALS: </i> </p>

<ul> 
<li> Learn to do arithmetic and HS algebra in various mods including
<ol>
<li> add, subtract, multiply, divide, invert, take powers
<li> solve linear equations in one variable (mod m) 
<li> solve systems of linear equations in one variable (mod m) 
<li> solve quadratic equations (mod m) 
<li> solve some higher power polynomial equations
<li> know under what conditions the above equations will have
        solutions and whether they will be unique or multiple. 
<li> Take powers and logarithms (log p) and use them to solve
        equations.  
</ol>
<li> Gain a deeper understanding of the arithmetic of the integers
  including:
<ol>
<li>the division algorithm and Euclid's algorithm
<li>solving linear diophantine equations
<li>divisibility properties and divsibility tests
<li>prime numbers and the Fundamental Thm. of Arithmetic
<li>number theoretic functions: tau, sigma, phi   
</ol>
</ul>

</i> http://seki.csuhayward.edu/3600.html
will be my Math 3600 homepage.  It will include a copy of the syllabus
and list of homework assignments. I will keep this updated throughout
the quarter.  </p>


<p><i> GRADING:</i>  Your grade will be based on two exams, weekly quizzes,
homework, participation and a portfolio of your work.  </p>

<p> The breakdown of points is: <br> <br>

</center>
</p>

<p><i> LEARNING: </i> <b> The only way to learn mathematics is by doing
it! </b>  Complete each 
assignment to the best of your ability, and get help when you are confused.
Come to class prepared with questions.  Don't hesitate to seek help from
other students.  Sometimes the point of view of someone who has just figured
something out can be the most helpful. </p>

<p> <i> DISABILITIES </i> If you have a documented disability and wish
to discuss academic accommodations, or if you would need assistance in
the event of an emergency, please contact me as soon as possible. </p>


<p> <i> HOMEWORK: </i> <a href="3600hw.pdf"> Homework</a> will be given for each lecture, and all the
homework assigned the previous week will be due the following Thursday.  
Please attempt all the problems by Tuesday, so that you can ask any
questions you may have in class then.  Except for routine computations,
you should always give reasons to support your work and explain what
you're doing.  Not all the problems will be graded, but only a 
subset.  Please write your solutions carefully. </p>

<p> The homework is meant to be challenging and somewhat open ended.
You may find yourself spending lots of time working on them and
sometimes getting frustrated.  This is natural.  I encourage you to work
with other people in person and using blackboard.  It's OK to get
significant help from any resource, but in the end, please write your
own solution in your own words.  <bf> Copying someone else's work
without credit is plagiarism and will be dealt with according to
university policty </bf> It also is a poor learning strategy.  

<p><i> MIDTERM:  </i> Thursday, 11 February 2003 in
class, Rearrange your schedule NOW if necessary.  </p>

<p><i> FINAL:  </i> Tuesday,  18 March 2003 in
class, Rearrange your schedule NOW if necessary.  </p>

<p><i> PARTICIPATION: </i> I expect you to generally show up prepared
for class and willing to work.  Please complete any assigned reading by
by the day <b> before</b> class.  Post at least 3 questions to
blackboard or email them to <i> 3600@seki.mcs.csuhayward.edu </i>.  This
will help me focus classtime where you need it most.  The questions can
be anything from "What does the following sentence from the text
mean..."  to "Why is it important that the derivative measures the
slope?"  But please be as clear as possible about where the confusion
is.  Questions like "What's a prime number?"  or "I don't understand the
Euclidean Algorithm?" are less useful than "I don't understand why 1 is
not considered a prime number" or "Here's my attempt to compute the gcd
of 343 and 182 using Euclid's algorithm, but I seem to get the wrong
answer...".  If you don't have any questions, then come up with three
sentences that describe the main points of the reading.  Twelve such
postings or emails over the course of the quarter will count as full
credit.  (Note that you need not send email before Review or Test Days.)
Since this class is so large, maybe odd people should send on Tuesday
and evens should send on Thursday (based on last digit of your student
ID), but don't feel you need to stick to that rigorously.
</p>

<p><i> PORTFOLIO:  </i> Please organize your work neatly in some sort of
binder (e.g., 3-ring), so that you can refer to all your classnotes,
homework assignments, quizzes, exams, handouts, and emails on the
reading.  I will check them at the end of the term. This will not only
help you during the class, but also later when you want to recall
something you learned but can't quite remember.  It gives you a
permanent record of what you learned even if you sell your book (which
I don't recommend).  
</p>

<p><i> CONTENT: </i>  Number theory is one of the most beautiful subjects
in all of mathematics.  People's fascination with number paterns
predates history and makes up the bulk of the knowledge that Euclid
wrote down in his <i> Elements </i>.  It has many problems that are easy
to understand but fiendishly difficult to solve. Perhaps the most famous
of these is "Fermat's Last Theorem", whose solution by Andrew Wiles
after 350 years is one of the highlights of 20th century mathematics.
</p>

<p> Many topics in number theory connect with and extend the pre-college
mathematics curriculum in interesting ways.  We will spend a lot of time
solving equations, but the rules will be somewhat different than you are
used to.  This should help you gain a deeper understanding of why
certain procedures you have learned in school (and may teach again
later) work.  </p>
