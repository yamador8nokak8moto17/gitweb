<i> WEB RESOURCE:  </i> http://seki.mcs.csuhayward.edu/~troby/1820.html
will be my Math 1820 homepage.  It will include a copy of the syllabus
and list of homework assignments. I will keep this updated throughout
the quarter.  
<br><br>

<i> GRADING:</i>  Your grade will be based on two exams, weekly quizzes,
homework, participation and a portfolio of your work.  

<br><br>
The breakdown of points is: <br> <br>

<b> The only way to learn mathematics is by doing it! </b>  Complete each
assignment to the best of your ability, and get help when you are confused.
Come to class prepared with questions.  Don't hesitate to seek help from
other students.  Sometimes the point of view of someone who has just figured
something out can be the most helpful.

<i> HOMEWORK:  </i> Homework will be given for each lecture, and all the
homework assigned the previous week will be due the following Thursday.
Please attempt all the problems by Tuesday, so that you can ask any
questions you may have in class then.  Except for routine computations,
you should always give reasons to support your work and explain what
you're doing.  Not all the problems will be graded, but only a small
subset; most of the ones assigned have answers in the back so you can
tell if you're on the right track.  This makes it more important that
you write your solutions carefully. <br><br>

<i> QUIZZES:  </i>  There will be a short quiz at the end of class each
Tuesday on the previous week's material.  I will try to be very specific
about what you should know.  Generally they will be very similar to the
"Matched Problems" that the book scatters throughout each section to
help you check your understanding.  
<br> <br>


<i> MIDTERM EXAM:  </i> Thursday, 3 February 2:00--3:50 in
class. Rearrange your schedule NOW if necessary.  <br> <br>

<i> FINAL EXAM:  </i> Tuesday, 14 March 2:00--3:50 in our usual 
classroom.  There will be no make-up final exams. If you
are unable to attend the final exam due to documented and unexpected
circumstances beyond your control, and you have at least a C average on
the previous coursework, an incomplete may be assigned. <br> <br>

<i> PARTICIPATION:  </i> I expect you to generally show up prepared for
class and willing to work.  Please read the section(s) to be covered by
the day <b> before</b> class, and send email to <i>
1820@seki.mcs.csuhayward.edu </i> with at least five (5) statements or
questions about the reading.  This will help me focus classtime where
you need it most.  The questions can be anything from "What does the
following sentence from the text mean..."  to "Why is it important that
the derivative measures the slope?"  If you don't have any questions,
then come up with five sentences that describe the main points of the
reading.  Twelve such emails over the course of the quarter will count
as full credit.  (Note that it doesn't apply to Review or Test Days.)
<br> <br>

<i> PORTFOLIO:  </i> Please organize your work neatly in some sort of
binder (e.g., 3-ring), so that you can refer to all your classnotes,
homework assignments, quizzes, exams, handouts, and emails on the
reading.  I will check them at the end of the term.  This will not only
help you during the class, but also later when you want to recall
something you learned but can't quite remember.  It gives you a
permanent record of what you learned even if you sell your book.
