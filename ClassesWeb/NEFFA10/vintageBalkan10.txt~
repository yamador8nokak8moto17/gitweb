Vintage Balkan session at NEFFA w/Tom Pixton 2008


Great balkan dances introduced at least 25 years ago.  Expedient
teaching for maximal dancing.  

PLANNED PROGRAM: [DID ALL BUT THE LAST ONE]

Hora Spoitorilor		Rom        Mihai
Ciganksi Orijent		Serb	   Murillo
Sej Sej Bob                     Bulg       Yves
Popvicanaka			Serb.      Gajicki
Jocul de-a Lungul		Rom        Mihai
XXDracevka			Maced.	   Crum

NOTES:

Tom was correct that we couldn't get through more than five dances in
the 50 minutes we had a NEFFA, given the complexity of some of these
dances for that crowd.  Ciganski Orijent has a number of pieces, so that
took a while.  Choosing different dances, could maybe get six.  But
always better to have time to review...
