<h3>Class Information</h3>

<i> Coordinates: </i>  Lectures meet Tues/Thur. 2:00--3:50 (#10081) in
Sci S. 205.  <br> <br>

<i> Text: </i> T. Bessarear<i> Mathematics for Elementary School
Teachers </i>  (Houghton Mifflin).
<br> <br>

<i> Web resource: </i> http://www.mcs.csuhayward.edu/~troby/4023.html
will be my Math 4023 homepage.  It will include a copy of the syllabus
and list of homework assignments. I will keep this updated throughout
the quarter.  
<br><br>

<i> Grading:</i>  There will be regular homework assignments handed 
weekly on Thursdays, one midterm exam
given in class, and a final.  Late homework will generally not be
accepted, and no makeup exams will be given, but your two lowest
homework scores will be dropped before grades are computed.
The breakdown of points is: <br> <br>

<TABLE BORDER="4" CELLPADDING="2">
<tr><th>Homework <th>Midterm <th>Final <br> 
<tr><th>40% <th>30% <th>30% <br> 
</TABLE>

<br><br>

<i> Homework:</i> Homework will be given for each lecture, and all the
homework assigned the previous week will be due the following Thursday.
Please attempt all the problems by Tuesday, so that you can ask any
questions you may have in class then.  Except for routine computations,
you should always give reasons to support your work and explain what
you're doing.  Not all the problems will be graded, but only a small
subset; most of the ones assigned have answers in the back so you can
tell if you're on the right track.  This makes it more important that
you write your solutions carefully. <br><br>

<i> Midterm Exam: </i> UPDATE! Tuesday May 11 2:00-3:50 in
class. Rearrange your schedule NOW if necessary.  <br> <br>

<i> Final Exam: </i>  Thursday June 10 2:00-3:50 (in usual classroom) This
will cover material from the entire course.  <br> <br>

<p> <b> The only way to learn mathematics is by doing it! </b>  Complete each
assignment to the best of your ability, and get help when you are confused.
Come to class prepared with questions.  Don't hesitate to seek help from
other students.  Sometimes the point of view of someone who has just figured
something out can be the most helpful. </p>

<p> <i> Content:</i> The concept of a <b> function </b> is basic to all
of mathematics.  Although elementary students don't encounter the formal
notion of a function, examples of functions are everywhere.  We will
study proportional reasoning, percents, data and chance, and do some
modeling using Excel spreadsheets.  

<p> <i> Computers:</i> Later on in the course we will spend some time
working with computers, specifically the spreadsheet <i> Microsoft
Excel</i>.  The CSU system has signed a licensing agreement with
Microsoft which makes Excel and many other MS programs available to CSUH
students, faculty, and staff at nominal cost.  Those of you with access
to computers at home or work can install Excel there if you don't have
it already.  It's also available in all the PC computer labs around
campus. If you are not yet comfortable with using computers or
spreadsheets, you may want to get a head start.  There are CBT Systems
On-Line Computer-Based Training Courses available. Contact the help desk
885-4357 or send an e-mail message to <i>
helpdesk@csuhayward.edu</i> . </p>



<h3> Homework Assignments </h3><p>
Homework is due on Thursdays at the beginning of class.  Try to start it
early so you have the opportunity to ask questions the Tuesday before.
I will try to keep a couple of weeks ahead, so those of you who would
like to work ahead can.
