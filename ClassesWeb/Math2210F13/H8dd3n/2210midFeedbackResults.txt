-----(1) List some things you like about the course (if any).--------

5    Professor
	* Genuinely wants students to learn and clearly understands all material
	* Humor
	* You actually want to teach us material rather than just talking and not
	  caring at all  
	* Enthusiasm and positive attitude
	* Humor.  Lightens the mood and is generally a unique touch.
	* Brings some humor to the class
	* Great math teacher sense of humor
	* Your focus on making sure we understand topics before moving
          on is a breath of fresh air compared to the rest of this
          department.  I just feel that you care more about our learning
          than our grades, and I really appreciate that.

5    Quizzes
	* Straightforward but hard enough so you know whether you
	  understand the problem or not. 
	* Reasonable difficulty.  
	* Quizzes are fair and see what you know.
     Take-home quizzes

12    Lectures/Use of technology for lectures
	* I like the way they are structured with the notes posted
	  online for printout and going over them in class. 
	* Availability of lecture notes online and quizzes
	* I like going to the lectures
	* How the lecture is presented, having all the notes online and printable
	* You do a good job connecting each lecture to the ones before it
	* Pretty engaging & easy to follow along with, with the printed notes.
	* I really like the fact that you use slides and technology but
	  I'm not sure if that necessary makes it better 
	* I enjoy your teaching style, it is fair and well-paced.  
	* Concepts taught clearly, relation of geometric consequences to algebraic work.
	* I like printing class notes rather than writing them in class.
	  This allows me to focus on class better. 
	* I like the slides
	* Your explanations usually make sense (sometimes a little
	  confusing).  Going over hw is also very helpful. 
2    TFRM cards
     T/F questions on hwk and quizzes
4    Homework
	* While they're usually fairly lengthy, I do find them useful
	* Mandatory Homework
	* Homework counting as part of grade
3    Textbook
     Q Center
	* I like spending time at Q ctr. to go over any questions I have.
     I like concentrating on the coursework!
2    Pace
	* I like how easy it is to keep up with course material
	* Pacing is good
3    Structure of class
	* I like how you spend a lot of time going through problems from quizzes and homework
	* The class is organized and easy to follow
	* How the class is set up, with quizzes and homework
	

-------(2) List some areas where you feel the course could be improved (if any).-------

4    Moves too fast
	* At times I wish the instructor would slow down but these are
	  times that are *few* and *far between*. 
	* "(2) - might going too fast because sometimes I forgot to
	  print the handouts and didn't have enough time to write down all
	  the important notes in class." [sic] 
	* I prefer to hand copy notes, with the speed the slides go it
	  can be difficult to keep up.  It would be nice to keep up
	  important definitions a bit longer. 

     Pace
	* I feel like we spend just as much time on very simple concepts
	  as we do on more abstract ones. 
	* Include online component  
	* MyMathLab had virtually unlimited practice problems with solutions.
2    Use blackboard more 
	* Instead of projector.  I prefer having all work done on blackboard 
	  where there is more room instead of a screen with text blocking. 
	* I think there should be a balance between using slides and the
	  board.  [Then in Q3 they wrote]: Talking about balance, maybe
  	  you could talk about concepts in the slides and then put the
  	  slides aside and work some problems on the board. 
     Less technology
	* The use of technology is sometimes distracting.  Also along those same
	  lines the technology allows for the pacing to become too fast. 
5    More True/False questions (in class)
	* to keep me engaged  
	* since they come up so often in HW, quizzes and tests
	* Could make better use of TFRM cards
2    Fewer True/False questions
	* I don't like T/F questions in quizzes
	* Personally I am not a fan of the TFRM cards
     More skill problems than conceptual problems 
	* so that I can get a better feel of the process
3    More time to address homework problems
	* We always breeze through it at the end of class, & it doesn't leave much
	  time to fix mistakes before we hand it in. 
     Less time addressing homework problems
	* I think we may spend a little too much time reviewing homework.  Maybe we
	  should spend no more than 15 or 20 minutes on review. 
2    More examples on board
	* If time allows it
     Review questions in class
     Teaching style  
	* I get bored staring at a screen while someone lectures.  Going through
	  material on the board step by step keeps me involved/paying attention. 
	* The way the lectures are structured, it's mainly you stating what is
	  happening.  In some cases this is better, but in other cases it doesn't give
	  as much "depth" required to properly learn some material. 
     Clarity of schedule
	* Due dates of HW and assignments convoluted
	* You should make it more clear which homeworks are due which week.  Either
	  posting them online or writing on board in class Tu/Th would be very
	  helpful. 
2    Homework
	* I find the homework to be too time consuming for the amount of practice I need they are superfluous.
	* It is hard to understand how to do some of the word problems for homework
	  and know how you would like them to be answered (examwise).  Also the T/F
	  questions in the textbook for HW do not have the answers int he back of the
	  book.  So if you could give answers to them, that would be awesome. 
     Occasional take-home quizzes
     Filled-in notes.  
	* It would be nice to have filled-in copies of the notes posted online after
	  we cover the topics, I can't always catch anything.  That is, understandably,
	  asking a lot - there isn't a lot of room for improvement, this class is very
	  good. 

-------(3) List some things you could do to improve your experience…--------

     More time on homework
     Attend office hours
6    Read textbook/review material before lecture
3    Do more problems 
	* esp odd numbers so I can tell if I understand
     Go over homework more in class
     More problem solving in class
4    Print out slides to follow along
	* not feasible though
	* without them the lecture moves too quickly to get good notes down.
	* I constantly forget to print lecture notes, making note-taking harder
	* The class is heavily reliant on worksheets, so if I printed those out
           again, that would definitely improve my experience. 
     * Giving feedbacks
     * "I spend a fair amt. of time on the HW but I need (to do myself) to make sure I
       have the defn's and the theorems down." 
     * None, having good experience in course
     * I missed a few classes from being ill, but I should have done a better job
       keeping up & not let myself fall as behind as I did. 
     * None, I haven't lost a point on quizzes and I feel I have a good understanding of the material to-date.
     * I don't take very good notes in quantitative class, it's a struggle to follow
       and copy down notes simultaneously.  I usually choose one or the other. 
     I would replace the TFRM cards with a show of hands, or just a verbal response.
2    Ask more questions
     Look at all matrices/problems in multiple ways.  Do some outside research/learning of linear algebra.

-------(4) Any other comments or suggestions?  (Feel free to use the back.)--------

     * I think this class is good for understanding concepts and that I don't feel
       I'm just churning answers out.  However, I feel that there may be too much
       emphasis on the conceptual and I prefer a better balance between the two.
       Perhaps one-third conceptual and two-thirds skill problems? 

     * So far so good!  I'll probably have more to say after the exam.
     * Would like to do more examples in class
     * Would love to know what the R and M in the TFRM cards stand for!

     * Keeping my concentration on the coursework at Storrs is really good for me,
       therapeutically as I mentioned earlier.  It's just not a grade for me.  The
       experience is two-fold.  1) experience makes me feel good. 2) the material and
       the fact that I'm learning something. 

     * Keep up sense of humor

     * You clearly want us all to do understand the material and do well in this
       class.  You are very passionate about teaching.  We notice and appreciate
       that. 

     * Overall I enjoy the class. The homework being due the next week gives us the
       proper amount of time to complete and be comfortable with our work. 

     * Sometimes I find it confusing as to when the homework for each section is due.
       I know the sections we covered are due the following week, but when we don't
       get all the way through a section, it gets confusing. 

     * Sometimes I feel like the class is going fast but that might be just me.

     * Nope!  Keep doing what you're doing, it really sets you apart from other
       professors here.  Oh, emailing major announcements, like homework extensions,
       would be awesome - it helps me stay on top of things. 

     * Ran out of free prints in the library on week 2 and I don't have my own
       printer, so I've since stopped having notes to follow along with. 

     * If you made an hour long (however many hours) help/go over problems session
       before the test, I would go. 

     * Overall the class is going pretty, I feel more time should be spent solving
       homework examples instead of mostly notes.  I learn by doing so doing hw
       problems and more examples over notes would benefit me.
