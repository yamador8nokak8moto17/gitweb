<h3>Class Information</h3>

<p><i> COORDINATES:  </i>  Lectures meet Tues/Thur. 12:30--1:45 in
MSB 215. The registrar calls this Sec 001, #12906 </p>

<p><i> PREREQUISITES:  </i> Understanding of abstract linear algebra and the
fundamentals of group theory and ring theory at the level of a
first-year graduate algebra course.  Some multilinear algebra (e.g.,
tensor products) will be useful, but will be reviewed quickly as needed.  </p>

<p> <i> TEXTS: (1) </i><a href="http://www.mth.msu.edu/~sagan/">Bruce E. Sagan</a>:

<p><i> GRADING:</i>  Your grade will be based on a takehome midterm exam,
homework, and a project. The breakdown of points is: <br> <br>

<p><i> CONTENT: </i> This course is an introduction to the
representation theory of finite groups and Lie algebras. Representation
theory studies the way in which a group may act on a vector space, which
means that each element of the group is represented as a matrix.  These
matrix representations can be built up from irreducible ones, which form
the building blocks for the construction of all representations of a
given group.  Understanding the representations of a group gives us new
insight into the group itself, as well as objects on which the group
acts.  </p>

<p>Representation theory has applications all over mathematics, from
algebra and number theory, to analysis, geometry, combinatorics, and
mathematical physics.  We will focus first on understanding the basic
tools in the simplest context of finite groups, then branch out to Lie
algebras.</p>

<p>Specific topics will include: characters, induced representations,
representations of the symmetric and general linear groups, symmetric
functions, Schur-Weyl duality, representations of complex semi-simple
Lie algebras, and the Weyl character formulae.  </p>

<p><i> LEARNING GOALS: </i> Besides becoming fluent in some basics of
this area and conversant with some deeper aspects, I expect that
students will learn or improve their ability:
<ul>
<li> to read mathematics independently from different books and research papers;
<li> to navigate the research literature using such tools as
MathSciNet and the ArXiv;
<li> to write mathematics clearly; and
<li> to present mathematics to others lucidly. 
</ul>
</p>

<p> <i> DISABILITIES </i> If you have a documented disability and wish
to discuss academic accommodations, or if you would need assistance in
the event of an emergency, please contact me as soon as possible. </p>

<p> <i> HOMEWORK: </i> Homework will be assigned
occasionally.  I will grade it on exposition as well as correctness.
