	   RESULTS FROM QUIZ \#4 MIDTERM FEEDBACK FOR MATH 3160 (Roby) Fall 2015

Each * represents one similar comment from Sec. 3, and # from Sec. 6.  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
LIST SOME THINGS YOU LIKE ABOUT THE COURSE (IF ANY): 

#################************ Good VL (good for notetaking, stopping to think, own pace, clear);
       (Chen and Roby have similar styles, VL are engaging, can speed them up; theory is
		    online, anytime access, great resource);
############*********** Flipped Classroom (FC) allows understanding lecture at own pace
		    (multiple times); efficient classtime and  VL;  
 -########***** Focussing on doing examples and (real-life) problems in class (CW);
 -#######***** likes working in groups (and that groups change, randomly);
 -* feels like small HS class;
#######** Socks ("socks are dope");
######*** Good HW (mandatory, length, frequency, forces me to practice, completion graded);
#######** Good Quizzes ([very] fair, weekly, similar to HW)
###**** Piazza (organized, can find HW); 
#####* Very good professor (attitude, enthusiasm, passion, desire for students to succeed); 
####* Sense of humor;
**** TRFM cards (are clever, help gain consensus, answer honestly wo/judgement);
#*** Class (subject matter, material) is fun/interesting (e.g., Test Positive, Monty Hall); 
#* Lots of examples, not just theory; 
* Pace of class; 
* HW, CW &  Quizzes are similar; 
* Thorough discussion of quizzes; 
* Treating wrong answers as learning opportunities;
* Likes outside-of-class resources; 
* Likes this probability that this quiz is 10/10; 
# Likes the challenge; 
# Lots of problems (in CW, HW, text); 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

LIST SOME AREAS WHERE YOU FEEL THE COURSE COULD BE IMPROVED (IF ANY): 


##########***** Quick review (recap) of VL in class (helps clear up confusion);  
######****** Would like to go over problems (CW and more HW), and spend less time in groups; 
####*** Would like solutions (at least answers) to CW problems; 
#**** Would like solutions to HW problems (not just numerical answers); 
##** Do some CW (in-class) examples step-by-step before groupwork; 
##** Lightboard writing sometimes hard to see (cut off, too small, background)
###* Not a fan of the text; 
###* TRFM Cards unusual, should use more; 
*** Sometimes groups are confused (and even unaware of this), can get wrong ideas in one's head; 
#** Videos are slow-paced, focus mostly on theory (more examples) 
#** Sometimes other group members didn't watch the video (and I did); 
*** Wouldn't change anything, can't think of any; 
** More worked out example problems (in class?); 
** Would like VL's slides posted; 
** Would prefer using Blackboard (more convenient) to Piazza (less user-friendly)
** remove theoretical questions from the HW, not helpful; 
#* Quizzes are too hard (grade concern); 
#* Socks are a bit much, pet peeve; 
#* Make sure problems are worded clearly and unambiguously; 
## Sometimes get lost during explanations of problems, take examples more slowly; 
* Sometimes one group gets something that not all get--feels unstructured; 
  (Make sure that beneficial comments made in one group get brought up to the class); 
# Add summary/takeaway slide at end of lecture; 
* Post HW problems and VL's earlier (Thursday instead of Saturday);
* Some class examples are harder than others (not so bad). 
* Unsure exactly how to study or approach the material; 
* Online VLs should be supplementary, not mandatory; 
# More organized VL; 
# VL technical issues with audio: balance, crackles
# Don't get much out of CW
* Would like Quiz solutions online; 
* Doesn't like VL: a) thinks it should fit into classtime
  	       	   b) hard to learn theory; would rather VL have many EGs, thy in class; 
		   c) hard with two different prof's; (maybe each can do both!)
* Don't assume students absorbed the video; 
* Would like questions similar to P exam; 
* Would like CW handouts posted;  ("I need to come to class more")
* Wants to leave early if finish classwork; 
* Would prefer to be taught material in class instead of VL; 
* Shorter HW or shorter CW so have more time for harder ones in class; 
* Classroom location bad (e.g., too hot); 
* maybe upload grades somewhere? Piazza or HuskyCT? 
# Just keep going.

LIST SOME THINGS YOU COULD DO TO IMPROVE YOUR EXPERIENCE IN THIS COURSE.  

############************* Spend more time (e.g., than zero) watching the VLs, take more notes, keep up with them;
 -###** Review online lectures more; 
 -#**** Take better notes ("need for FORCE myself to take notes"); 
 -##* Review VL quickly before class (but don't wait until last minute); 
#########******* Do more practice (suggested) problems; 
####** Read text more (don't just accept theorems without thinking, don't rely totally on VL); 
##*** Ask more questions, participate more, come to office hours; 
#*** Study for quizzes more in depth; 
##* Spend more time on CW after class;
## Study More/Work harder [!]; 
## Form study groups, work with classmates outside of class; 
* Be more collaborative during groupwork (prefers to try on own first); 
* If class participated more, class would improve dramatically; 
* Not be so invested in my other classes; 
* Study Quiz and CW problems; 
* Come to class more [!]; 
# Do HW earlier, rather than night before; 
# Work with Piazza more; 
# Watch YouTube videos :-(. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR SUGGESTIONS: 


#* Harder than expected (hard transition from previous math, overwhelmed by the HW); 
* Overall like the course and format; 
* Really like this class, and surprised that liked FC format; 
* Maybe have homework due Tuesday (after quiz?) rather than Thursday;
* Not a fan of length of some of the VLs;
* Let students pick the groups; 
# I don't use piazza or the text; 

"Class is very fair on all fronts, zero (bad) surprises, and the grade distribution is ideal"

"Probability strictly on material is one of the most appealing courses I have taken at UConn.  I have always found
probability both useful and interesting, so I have enjoyed learning about it."  

"I find this course very interesting and unlike anything I've ever done before.  As a
senior, I've had a wide range of classes and professors and you are one of those professors
who makes showing up to class worth it.  I am glad I chose to enroll in your section."  

"I am a Political Science and Econ. major. I really appreciate how accessible you've made
this course for someone who doesn't spend a great deal of their classes in the math arena."
