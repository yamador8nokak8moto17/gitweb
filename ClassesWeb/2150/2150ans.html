<h3> Homework #3 </h3>

Sec. 4.1
Induction proofs were not written out correctly.  Proofs were very choppy and 
I looked at the book, and the book did the proofs quite nicely.  It would be 
great if you can do a properly written induction proof for your students to 
take note. <br>

19)  a=116 and d = -7  a) -1977  b) -480 does not belong to the sequence  
c) -279,150  ; 
23)  1023/32 ; 
32) 766.56 <br>

Sec. 4.3 
8) a(n) = 2(3^n) - 2((-1)^n);
9) a(n) = 40 + (-3)n;
10) a(n) = (5)(-4)^n - (-37/4)n((-4)^n);
