<h3>Class Information</h3>

<i> Coordinates: </i>  Lectures meet Tues/Thur. 4:00--5:50 (10275) in WA
UM08.  <br> <br>

<i> Text: </i>  Burton, David M. <i> Elementary Number Theory (4th Ed.) </i>
McGraw-Hill, 1998.  <br> <br>

<i> Grading: </i>  There will be weekly homework assignments, weekly quizzes,
one midterm exam given in class and a final. Late homework
will not be accepted, and no makeup exams will be given, but your lowest
two quiz and lowest two homework scores will be dropped.  If you have to
miss an exam for some reason, please see me beforehand as soon as
possible.  The breakdown of points is: <br> <br>

<TABLE BORDER="4" CELLPADDING="2">
<tr><th>Homework <th>Quizzes <th>Midterm <th>Final <br> 
<tr><th>25% <th>25% <th>20% <th>30% <br> 
</TABLE>

<br><br>
<i> Quizzes: </i>  There will be a short quiz at the end of class each
Tuesday on the assigned reading.  I will try to be very specific about what
you should know.  If you're not sure, please ask!
<br> <br>

<i> Midterm Exam: </i> Tuesday February 9 in class.  Please rearrange
your schedule now if necessary.  It will cover material through Section
5.4 of Burton.  <br> <br>

<i> Final Exam: </i>  Thursday March 18 4:00--5:50.  <br><br>

<i> Content: </i>  Number theory is one of the most beautiful subjects
in all of mathematics.  Our goal is to cover most of chapters 1--9 of
Burton, culminating in Gauss's law of quadratic reciprocity.  Other
topics as time permits. <br> <br>

<b> The only way to learn mathematics is by doing it! </b>  Complete each
assignment to the best of your ability, and get help when you are
confused.  Come to class prepared with questions, having read the text
with pencil and paper at hand.  Don't hesitate to
seek help from other students.  Sometimes the point of view of someone
who has just figured something out can be the most helpful.
