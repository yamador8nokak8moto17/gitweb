<h3>Class Information</h3>

<i> Coordinates: </i>  Lectures meet Tues/Thur. 2:00--3:50 in WA
UM08.  <br> <br>

<i> Texts: </i>  Wilf, Herbert. <i> Generatingfunctionology (2nd ed.)
</i>  Academic Press, 1994.   <br> <br>

<i> Grading: </i>  There will be weekly homework assignments, weekly quizzes,
one midterm exam given in class and a final. You may do a final project
in the place of the final exam.  Late homework
will not be accepted, and no makeup exams will be given.  If you have to
miss an exam for some reason, please see me beforehand as soon as
possible.  The breakdown of points is: <br> <br>

<TABLE BORDER="4" CELLPADDING="2">
<tr><th>Homework <th>Quizzes <th>Midterm <th>Final <br> 
<tr><th>25% <th>25% <th>20% <th>30% <br> 
</TABLE>

<br><br>
<i> Quizzes: </i>  There will be a short quiz at the end of class each
Tuesday on the assigned reading.  I will try to be very specific about what
you should know.  If you're not sure, please ask!
<br> <br>

<i> Final Projects: </i>  Instead of a final exam, 4155 you may elect to
work on a project which involves researching some topic in the
combinatorics literature, writing a paper, and presenting to the
instructor. Such a project, including a presentation to the class, will
be <b>required</b> of everyone taking the course for graduate credit (6155).
Topics must be choosen and approved by the instructor by Thursday 1/21.
Start thinking *now* about what might interest you.  The skills you
exercise for this project will be extremely useful to you in the future,
even if you don't use the particular mathematics you study ever again. 

<i> Midterm Exam: </i> Tuesday February 16 in class.  Please rearrange
your schedule now if necessary.  <br> <br>

<i> Final Exam: </i>  Tuesday March 16 2:00--3:50.  <br><br>

<i> Content: </i>  Combinatorics is the art of counting.  We will study
many different ways to count things, and use tools from calculus,
linear algebra, and other parts of mathematics.  There are many
beautiful results with elegant proofs, which require very little
background to understand.  Combinatorics has relatively recently come
into its own as an accepted mainstream area of research, but
combinatorial problems have been intriguing mathematicians in most
fields for centuries.  

<b> The only way to learn mathematics is by doing it! </b>  Complete each
assignment to the best of your ability, and get help when you are
confused.  Come to class prepared with questions, having read the text
with pencil and paper at hand.  Don't hesitate to
seek help from other students.  Sometimes the point of view of someone
who has just figured something out can be the most helpful.
