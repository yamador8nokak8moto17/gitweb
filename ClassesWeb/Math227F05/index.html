<h3>Class Information</h3>

<p><i> COORDINATES:  </i>  Lectures meet Tues/Thur. 2:00--3:15 in
MSB 403. The registrar calls this Sec 003, #26935 </p>

<p><i> PREREQUISITES:  </i> Math 116 or Math 121 

<p> <i> TEXT: </i>  David C. Lay, <i> Linear Algebra And Its
Applications, 3rd ed.</i> Addison-Wesley.  
</p>

<p><i> WEB RESOURCES: </i> The homepage for this course is <a
href="http://www.math.uconn.edu/~troby/Math227F05/">
http://www.math.uconn.edu/~troby/Math227F05/</a>. It will include a copy
of the syllabus and list of homework assignments. I will keep this
updated throughout the quarter.  </p>

<p> </i> This course will have a WebCT homepage (once
I figure out how to get that setup), with 
discussion forums that I strongly encourage you to use.  Your
participation grade will be partly based on the number of useful
messages you contribute.  Go to WebCT at <a
href=http://webct.uconn.edu/> 
http://webct.uconn.edu/</a>.  For help with WebCT go to <a
href="http://irc.uconn.edu/Student_WebCT_HELP.htm">
http://irc.uconn.edu/Student_WebCT_HELP.htm </a>. </p>


<p><i> GRADING:</i>  Your grade will be based on two midterm exams, a
final exam, quizzes, and participation. </p>

<p> The breakdown of points is: <br> <br>

<center>
<TABLE BORDER="4" CELLPADDING="2">
<tr><th> Midterm 1 <th> Midterm 2 <th> Final <th> Quizzes <th> Participation
<br> 
<tr><th>20% <th>20% <th>30% <th>20% <th>10% <br> 
</TABLE>
</center>
</p>


<p><i> EXAMS: </i> All exams are culumulative, though the second
midterm will focus on material from the second part of the course.  The
exam dates are already scheduled, so please mark your calendars now.  No
makeups will be given; instead if you have an approved reason for
missing an exam, the final will count for the appropriately higher
percentage. </p>

<p> <i> QUIZZES: </i> Quizzes will be scheduled pseudo-randomly, but 
will always cover problems similar to those on recent homework.  Your
lowest two quiz scores will be dropped. </p>

<ul>
<li> Here are the <a href="quiz1sol.pdf"> solutions to Quiz #1 </a>
</ul>


<p><i> LEARNING GOALS: </i> 

Learn to work with both the computational and abstract aspects of
linear algebra including:
<ul>
<li> solve systems of equations via matrices
<li> work with vector spaces and different bases for them 
<li> work with eigenvectors and eigenvalues
<li> understand and use various matrix factorizations
</ul>
</p>

<p><i> LEARNING: </i> <b> The only way to learn mathematics is by doing
it! </b>  Complete each 
assignment to the best of your ability, and get help when you are confused.
Come to class prepared with questions.  Don't hesitate to seek help from
other students.  Sometimes the point of view of someone who has just figured
something out can be the most helpful. </p>

<p> <i> DISABILITIES </i> If you have a documented disability and wish
to discuss academic accommodations, or if you would need assistance in
the event of an emergency, please contact me as soon as possible. </p>

<p> <i> HOMEWORK: </i> <a href="hw.html"> Homework <a/> will be given for each section of the
book, and should be done by the next class meeting.  You can ask
questions about the homework in one of the WebCT forums.  Except for
routine computations, you should always give reasons to support your
work and explain what you're doing.  I will not generally collect
homework, but may occasionally just to check that it's being done.  </p>

<p> You may find some homework problems to be challenging, leading you
to spend lots of time working on them and sometimes get frustrated.
This is natural.  I encourage you to work with other people in person
and using blackboard.  It's OK to get significant help from any
resource, but in the end, please write your own solution in your own
words.  <bf> Copying someone else's work without credit is plagiarism
and will be dealt with according to <a
href="acadInteg.html">
university policy</a>.</bf> It also is a poor learning strategy.
