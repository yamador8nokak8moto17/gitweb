Go over Midterm 2

If time, briefly talk about 6.1:

DEF: dot product, norm, distance, orthogonal
Thm1: I just properties: comm, distrib, scalars, "semi-def"
DEF: norm of vector
DEF: unit vector (just divide by norm)
EG: Let W be subspace of R^3 spanned by (1/2, 2/3, 5), find a unit
    vector that is a basis for W. 

THM2: (Pythagorean) u and v are perp. iff ||u+v||^2 = ||u||^2 +||v||^2

THM: (Row A)^Perp = Nul A; (Col A)^Perp = Nul A^T
Draw picture (like p. 3800)

* Go over 6.1 stuff quickly. 

DEF: *orthogonal set* of vectors (pairwise orthogonal)
EG: EASY to CHECK (6.2 #2) S= {(1,-2,1), (0,1,2), (-5,-2,1)}
THM: If S={u_1,...u_p} is orthog., nonzero, in R^n, then S is linind;
     hence, S is basis for span S in R^n.
PF: If 0=lin. comb of u_i's, then dot each side w/u_j. 
DEF: An orthog basis for subsp W in R^n is basis that is also an ortho set
THM: Let {u_1,...u_p} be an orthg. basis for W in R^n.  Then can compute
weights c_i in expansion y=sum c_iu_i as c_j = (y.u_j)/(u_j.u_j)
PF: As above. 
EG: S in above EG is orthog; express (3,-2,4) as lin. comb
    EASY to compute WTs: No linear system needed!
ORTHOG PROJECTION:

Given nonzero u in R^n, want to write y=y^+z where y^=\alpha u
i.e, as sum of components, one of which points in the direction of u,
the other of which is orthogonal to u.  [PICTURE].

EG: Compute orthogProj of (1,-1) onto line through u=(-1,3) and (0,0). 
    Write (1,-1) as sum of two orthogonal vectors, one in Span{u}. 
    Find distance from (1,-1) to the line given above.
EG: In physics we do this all the time, decomposting a force into is
    components.  

DEF: An *Orthonormal Set* is an orthogonal set of unit vectors.  
EG: standard basis for R^n: e_1,..., e_n. 
REM: It's easy to make Ogonal set Onormal, but dividing by resp. norms. 
Matrices whose columns are orthonormal come up in many applications
THM: An mxn matrix U has orthonormal colums IFF U^U=I
PF: Assume WMLOG, U has three cols, U=[u_1 u_2 u_3]
    (maybe also do EG)
THM: Let U be mxn mx w/o.normal cols, x, y in R^n:
     a) ||Ux|| = ||x||  [U is *length preserving*]
     b) (Ux).(Uy)=x.y	[U is *angle preserving*]
     c) (Ux).(Uy)=0 IFF x.y = 0

6.3 Orthogonal Projections

[Picture] of plane W, w/point y floating above projected to W.
REM: Can always write y=z_1 +z_2, where z_1 is linear comb. of basis
     vectors in W, and z_2 is lin. comb. of basis vectors in W^perp. 

THM: (*Orthogonal Decomposition Theorem) Let W be a subspace of R^n.
     Then each y in R^n  can be written uniquely as y=y^+z, where y^ in
     W and z in W^perp.  In fact, if {u_1,...u_p} is any orthog basis of
     W, then  
	      y^=(yu.u_1)/(u_1.u_1)u_1 +...
	      z=y-y^.
