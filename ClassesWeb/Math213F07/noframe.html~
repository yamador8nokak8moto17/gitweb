<h3>Class Information</h3>

<p class="mathpar"><i> COORDINATES:  </i>  Classes meet Tues/Thur. 11:00--12:15 in
MSB 219. The registrar calls this Sec 001, #8522 </p>

<p class="mathpar"><i> PREREQUISITES:  </i> Some calculus, but we won't
use it very much.  More important is the ability to work hard on
unfamiliar problems.  This course itself is a prerequisite for most
upper division courses in math. </p>

<p class="mathpar"> <i> TEXT: </i> John D'Angelo & <a
href="http://www.math.uiuc.edu/~west/"> Doug West</a>: <i> <a
href="http://www.math.uiuc.edu/~west/mt/" Mathematical Thinking:
Problem-Solving and Proofs</a></i>, Prentice Hall 2000.
Second edition 412+xx pages, 930 exercises, 180 figures ISBN
0-13-014421-6.   </p>

<p class="mathpar"><i> WEB RESOURCES: </i> The homepage for this course is <a
href="http://www.math.uconn.edu/~troby/Math213F07/">
http://www.math.uconn.edu/~troby/Math213F07/</a>. It will include a copy
of the syllabus and list of homework assignments. I will keep this
updated throughout the quarter.  </p>

<p class="mathpar"><i> GRADING:</i>  Your grade will be based on a midterm exam, a final
exam, homework, and quizzes. </p>

<p class="mathpar"> The breakdown of points is: <br> <br>

<center>
<TABLE BORDER="4" CELLPADDING="2">
<tr><th> Midterm <th> Final <th> Quizzes <th> Homework/Participation 
<br> 
<tr><th>25% <th>40% <th>15% <th>20% <br> 
</TABLE>
</center>
</p>


<p class="mathpar"><i> EXAMS: </i> 
The exam dates are already scheduled, so please mark your calendars now.
No makeups will be given; instead if you have an approved reason for 
missing an exam, the final will count for the appropriately higher
percentage. If you know you have a conflict, please let me know asap. </p>

<p class="mathpar"><i> CONTENT: </i> This content of this course is
how to <b>DO</b> mathematics.  The specific choice of
topics is less important your ability to come to grips with different
kinds of mathematical thinking and writing.  We plan to cover most of
the Chapters 1-14 of the text, except 9 and 12.  
<ul>
<li> Numbers, Sets, and Functions
<li> Language and Proofs
<li> Induction
<li> Bijections and Cardinality
<li> Combinatorial Reasoning
<li> Divisibility
<li> Modular Arithmetic
<li> The Rational Numbers
<li> The Real Numbers
<li> Sequences & Series
<li> Two Principles of Counting
<li> Graph Theory
</ul>

<p class="mathpar"><i> LEARNING GOALS: </i> By the end of the course you
should be able to
<ul>
<li> Explore unfamiliar mathematical problems using examples</li>
<li> Formulate precise mathematical statements ("conjectures") that can
be proven or disproven.</li>
<li> Understand how to negate a mathematical statement and how to
disprove a conjecture using a counterexample</li>
<li> Use various methods of proof, including mathematical induction,
bijections, contradiction, and some epsilonics,  to demonstrate the
truth of mathematical facts.</li>
<li> Be able to communicate mathematics clearly orally and in writing<li>
<li> Discriminate between correct proofs, informal reasoning, wishful
thinking, and falsehoods.</li>
</ul>

<p class="mathpar"><i> LEARNING: </i> <b> The only way to learn mathematics is by doing
it! </b>  Complete each 
assignment to the best of your ability, and get help when you are confused.
Come to class prepared with questions.  Don't hesitate to seek help from
other students.  Sometimes the point of view of someone who has just figured
something out can be the most helpful. </p>

<p class="mathpar"> We will often spend classtime doing things in
groups, presenting mathematics to one another, or having interactive
discussions.  There will not be time for "cover" all material in a
lecture format so you will need to read and learn some topics from the
book.   </p>

<p class="mathpar"> <i> DISABILITIES </i> If you have a documented disability and wish
to discuss academic accommodations, or if you would need assistance in
the event of an emergency, please contact me as soon as possible. </p>

<p class="mathpar"> <i> HOMEWORK: </i> <a href="hw.html"> Homework <a/> will be assigned weekly
I will collect homework and grade a pseudorandom sample of it.</p>

<p class="mathpar"> You may find some homework problems to be challenging, leading you
to spend lots of time working on them and sometimes get frustrated.
This is natural.  I encourage you to work with other people in person
or electronically.  It's OK to get significant help from any
resource, but in the end, please write your own solution in your own
words.  <bf> Copying someone else's work without credit is plagiarism
and will be dealt with according to <a
href="acadInteg.html"> university policy</a>.</bf> It also is a poor learning strategy.
