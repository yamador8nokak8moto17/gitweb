<h3>Class Information</h3>

<i> Coordinates: </i>  Lectures meet Tues/Thur. 6:00--7:50 (#11719) in
Sci Science 213.  <br> <br>

<i> Text: </i> J. Gallian <i> Contemporary Abstract Algebra
4th Ed.  </i> (Houghton-Mifflin, 1998)
<br> <br>

<i> Web resource: </i> http://seki.mcs.csuhayward.edu/~troby/3121.html
will be my Math 3121 homepage.  It will include a copy of the syllabus
and list of homework assignments. I will keep this updated throughout
the quarter.  
<br><br>

<i> Grading:</i> There will be daily homework assignments (handed in
weekly on Thursday), weekly quizzes (given on Tuesdays), one midterm exam
given in class, and a final.  Late homework will generally not be
accepted, and no makeup exams will be given, but your two lowest
homework and quiz scores will be dropped before grades are computed. If
you do not take the midterm or you miss more than two quizzes, your
final exam score will also be the score for your midterm or missing
quizzes.
 
<br><br>
The breakdown of points is: <br> <br>

<TABLE BORDER="4" CELLPADDING="2">
<tr><th>Homework <th>Quizzes <th>Midterm <th>Final <br> 
<tr><th>25% <th>25% <th>25% <th>25% <br> 
</TABLE>

<br><br>


<i> Content:</i> The goal is to cover the first 11 chapters of the text,
which comprise an introduction to group theory.  We may omit some
applications for lack of time, but you are encouraged to read all eleven
chapters.  The next course in the sequence, Math 3122, will start with
ring theory, which Gallian covers in later chapters.
<br><br>
<b> The only way to learn mathematics is by doing it! </b>  Complete each
assignment to the best of your ability, and get help when you are confused.
Come to class prepared with questions.  Don't hesitate to seek help from
other students.  Sometimes the point of view of someone who has just figured
something out can be the most helpful.

<h3> Lecture and Assignment Schedule</h3><p>

<br>
<i> Homework:</i> Homework will be given for each lecture, and all the
homework assigned the previous week will be due the following Thursday.
Please attempt all the problems by Tuesday, so that you can ask any
questions you may have in class then.  Except for routine computations,
you should always give reasons to support your work and explain what
you're doing.  Not all the problems will be graded, but only a small
subset; most of the ones assigned have answers in the back so you can
tell if you're on the right track.  This makes it more important that
you write your solutions carefully. <br><br>

<i> Quizzes: </i>  There will be a short quiz at the end of class each
Tuesday on the previous week's material.  I will try to be very specific
about what you should know.  If you're not sure, please ask!
<br> <br>


<i> Midterm Exam: </i> Thursday, 28 October 6:00-7:50 in
class. Rearrange your schedule NOW if necessary.  <br> <br>

<i> Final Exam: </i> Thursday, 9 December 6:00-7:50 in our usual
classroom. There will be no make-up final exams. If you 
are unable to attend the final exam due to documented and unexpected
circumstances beyond your control, and you have at least a C average on
the previous coursework, an incomplete may be assigned. <br> <br>
