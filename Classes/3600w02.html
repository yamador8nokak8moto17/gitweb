<h3>Class Information</h3>

<p><i> COORDINATES:  </i>  Lectures meet Tues/Thur. 6:00--7:50 (#10595 01) in
Science South 302.  </p>

<p> <i> TEXTS: </i>  
Burton, David M. <i> Elementary Number Theory (4th Ed.) </i>
McGraw-Hill, 1998.  <br> 
</ul>

</p>
<p><i> WEB RESOURCE:  </i> http://seki.csuhayward.edu/3600.html
will be my Math 3600 homepage.  It will include a copy of the syllabus
and list of homework assignments. I will keep this updated throughout
the quarter.  </p>


<p><i> GRADING:</i>  Your grade will be based on two exams, weekly quizzes,
homework, participation and a portfolio of your work.  </p>

<p> The breakdown of points is: <br> <br>

<p><i> LEARNING: </i> <b> The only way to learn mathematics is by doing
it! </b>  Complete each 
assignment to the best of your ability, and get help when you are confused.
Come to class prepared with questions.  Don't hesitate to seek help from
other students.  Sometimes the point of view of someone who has just figured
something out can be the most helpful. </p>

<p> Please read the sections from the book listed <b> before </b> the
date of the first lecture on that material.  To encourage this, I will
give credit for emailing me with questions and statements about the
assigned reading (see "Participation" below).  <p>


<p> <i> HOMEWORK: </i> Homework will be given for each lecture, and all the
homework assigned the previous week will be due the following Thursday.
Please attempt all the problems by Tuesday, so that you can ask any
questions you may have in class then.  Except for routine computations,
you should always give reasons to support your work and explain what
you're doing.  Not all the problems will be graded, but only a 
subset.  Please write your solutions carefully. </p>

<p>You do not need to hand in the answers to question I've included in
[square brackets], but you should do them to prepare for... </p>

<p><i> QUIZZES: </i> There will be a short quiz at the end of class each
Tuesday on the previous week's material.  I will try to be very specific
about what you should know, often by handing sheets of practice
problems.  Generally they will be comparable to easier problems I assign
and to the examples given in the reading.  </p>

<p><i> MIDTERM:  </i> Thursday, 7 February 2002 in
class, Rearrange your schedule NOW if necessary.  </p>

<p><i> FINAL:  </i> Tuesday,  19 March 2002 in
class, Rearrange your schedule NOW if necessary.  </p>

<p><i> PARTICIPATION: </i> I expect you to generally show up prepared
for class and willing to work.  Please read the section(s) to be covered
by the day <b> before</b> class, and send email to <i>
3600@seki.mcs.csuhayward.edu </i> with at least five (5) statements or
questions about the reading.  This will help me focus classtime where
you need it most.  The questions can be anything from "What does the
following sentence from the text mean..."  to "Why is it important that
the derivative measures the slope?"  But please be as clear as possible
about where the confusion is.  Questions like "What's a prime number?"
or "I don't understand the Euclidean Algorithm?" are less useful than "I
don't understand why 1 is not considered a prime number" or "Here's my
attempt to compute the gcd of 343 and 182 using Euclid's algorithm, but
I seem to get the wrong answer...".  If you don't have any questions,
then come up with five sentences that describe the main points of the
reading.  Twelve such emails over the course of the quarter will count
as full credit.  (Note that you need not send email before Review or Test Days.)
</p>

<p><i> PORTFOLIO:  </i> Please organize your work neatly in some sort of
binder (e.g., 3-ring), so that you can refer to all your classnotes,
homework assignments, quizzes, exams, handouts, and emails on the
reading.  I will check them at the end of the term. This will not only
help you during the class, but also later when you want to recall
something you learned but can't quite remember.  It gives you a
permanent record of what you learned even if you sell your book (which
I don't recommend).  
</p>

<p><i> MATERIAL: </i>  Number theory is one of the most beautiful subjects
in all of mathematics.  People's fascination with number paterns
predates history and makes up the bulk of the knowledge that Euclid
wrote down in his <i> Elements </i>.  It has many problems that are easy
to understand but fiendishly difficult to solve. Perhaps the most famous
of these is "Fermat's Last Theorem", whose solution by Andrew Wiles
after 350 years is one of the highlights of 20th century mathematics.
</p>

<p> Many topics in number theory connect with and extend the pre-college
mathematics curriculum in interesting ways.  We will spend a lot of time
solving equations, but the rules will be somewhat different than you are
used to.  This should help you gain a deeper understanding of why
certain procedures you have learned in school (and may teach again
later) work.  </p>

<p> Our goal is to cover most of chapters 1--9 of
Burton, culminating in Gauss's law of quadratic reciprocity.  Other
topics as time permits. I will continue to update the schedule below as
the term progresses. </p>
