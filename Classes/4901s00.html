<h3>Class Information</h3>

<p> Math 4901 (Senior Seminar) is designed to be a capstone experience
for students who are about to graduate.  It carries two units of
credit, and therefore meets only once a week.  This quarter we will
organize it around student presentations.  Each student will give 3--4
presentations in class.  The other assigned work will be to read a book
or article (that you haven't read before), and write a short report on
it, and to do a few problems based on other lectures.  </p>

<p> <i> COORDINATES:  </i>  Lectures meet Tuesdays 6:00--7:50p.m. (#12052 01) in
Sci Science 247.  </p>

<p> <i> TEXT:  </i> Fomin, Genkin, & Itenberg
<i> Mathematical Circles (Russian Experience)</i> American Mathematical
Society, Mathematical World, Vol. 7.  This has some great problems.  
</p>

<p> <i> WEB RESOURCE:  </i> http://seki.csuhayward.edu/4901.html
will be my Math 4901 homepage.  It will include a copy of the syllabus
and list of homework assignments. I will keep this updated throughout
the quarter.  
<br><br>

<p> <i> GRADING:</i>  Your grade will be based on 3--4 oral presentations 
(in class), a report on a mathematics book or article you read, and
homework assigned and graded by your peers.

<p> <i> HOMEWORK: </i> Each presenter will handout a set of five exercises,
which are doable after the lecture.  These should be simple enough that
they don't take a lot of time, but not so simple that they can be
answered without any thought.  These will be handed in the next
week to the presenter, who will grade them.  </p>

<p> <i> REPORTS: </i>  Choose an article from the <i> American
Mathematical Monthly </i> or a book to read and write a short 5 page
report on it.  If time permits, there may be presentations on these
at the end of the quarter. </p>

<p> Your report should be interesting to read in its own right.  </p>

<p> <i> PRESENTATIONS: </i>  Each presentation should last 10 minutes
(strictly enforced with a timer!). There will be a couple of minutes for
questions at the end of each presentation.  Please handin a typed
summary of your presentation to me, and handout a homework assignment
as described above (make enough copies) to the class.  You may choose your
topic from among those given below, or get approval from me for a
different one.  </p>
