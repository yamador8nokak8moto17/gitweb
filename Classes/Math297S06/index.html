<h3>Class Information</h3>

<p><i> COORDINATES:  </i>  Lectures meet Tues/Thur. 12:30--1:45 in
CUE 133. The registrar calls this Sec 002, #12292 </p>

<p><i> PREREQUISITES:  </i> Consent of instructor.  I hope most of you
know some linear algebra (what's covered in 227 is plenty) and have had
some experience doing proofs.  If not, let me know so we can figure out
additional resources that might help. 

<p> <i> TEXT: </i>  <a href="http://www.math.ufl.edu/~bona/">Miklos
Bona</a>, <i> Introduction to Enumerative Combinatorics,</i> McGraw
Hill, 2007[!].  ISBN-13: 978-0-07-312561-9, ISBN-10: 0-07-312561-X. 
</p>

<p><i> WEB RESOURCES: </i> The homepage for this course is <a
href="http://www.math.uconn.edu/~troby/Math297S06/">
http://www.math.uconn.edu/~troby/Math297S06</a>. It will include a copy
of the syllabus and list of homework assignments. I will keep this
updated throughout the semester.  </p>

<p> </i> This course has a WebCT VISTA homepage, with 
discussion forums that I strongly encourage you to use.  Go to WebCT at 
<a href=http://webct.uconn.edu/> 
http://webct.uconn.edu/</a>.  For help with WebCT go to <a

<p><i> LEARNING GOALS: </i> 

Students will learn the basic techniques of enumerative combinatorics
and how to apply these to a wide range of problems within discrete
math.  Specific content will include Chapters 1-3 of Bona, and a
selection of topics from the rest of the book.  (My favorites are
chapters 4,5,8 and 9.)</p>

<p> More importantly, students will gain experience in skills of global
importance within (and beyond) mathematics: 

<ul>
<li> constructing and carefully writing up rigorous proofs
<li> solving problems for which templates are not given
<li> presenting mathematics to others
</ul>
</p>

<p><i> LEARNING: </i> <b> The only way to learn mathematics is by doing
it! </b> I expect everyone in this class to be actively engaged with
material.  Come to class prepared with questions.  Don't hesitate to
seek help from other students as well as me.  Sometimes the point of
view of someone who has just figured something out can be the most
helpful. </p>

<p> <i> DISABILITIES </i> If you have a documented disability and wish
to discuss academic accommodations, or if you would need assistance in
the event of an emergency, please contact me as soon as possible. </p>


<p><i> GRADING:</i>  Your grade will be based on a midterm exam,
homework, and a project. The breakdown of points is: <br> <br>

<center>
<TABLE BORDER="3" CELLPADDING="2">
<tr><th> Homework <th> Midterm <th> Project <br> 
<tr><th>30% <th>30% <th>40%  <br> 
</TABLE>
</center>
</p>


<p><i> MIDTERM EXAM: </i> Will cover all the material to that point in
the term.  It is scheduled for 23 March.  No makeups can be given, so
please mark your calendar now.</p>

<p> <i> HOMEWORK: </i> Homework will be assigned for each class, and should
be attempted by the next class meeting.  I will collect homework for
each week on thursday of the following week.  You can ask 
questions about the homework in one of the WebCT forums.  Except for
routine computations, you should always give reasons to support your
work and explain your reasoning.  I will collect homework and grade
some (pseudo randomly selected) subset of the problems. </p>

<p> You may find some homework problems to be challenging, leading you
to spend lots of time working on them and sometimes get frustrated.
This is natural.  I encourage you to work with other people in person
and using WebCT.  It's OK to get significant help from any
resource, but in the end, please write your own solution in your own
words.  <bf> Copying someone else's work without credit is plagiarism
and will be dealt with according to <a
href="acadInteg.html">
university policy</a>.</bf> It also is a poor learning strategy.</p>

<p> Bona has a section of "Exercises" for each chapter that come with
complete solutions, as well as "Supplementary Exercises" without
solutions.  I recommend that you attempt most of the former, turning to
the solutions as little as possible.  Collected homework will generally
be taken from the latter.  </p>

<p><i> <a href="projects.html">PROJECTS:</a></i> are described in the
link.  Please select your research topics by 9 February.  First drafts
of papers are due 10 April.  Presentations will start shortly
thereafter.
