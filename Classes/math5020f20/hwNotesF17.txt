**************************************************************************************
 

PROBLEMS ASSIGNED:

<p> <b>Problem Set 1 (due 1 October 2020)</b> Turn in your "best" four problems from 
1.4 (i.e., Chapter 1, Problem 4 (page 104)), 1.5, 
1.7, 1.12, 1.17, 1.29, 1.33, 
A1, A2, A3. 
There is a 50% penalty on Problem 1.12 for using induction,
recurrences, generating functions, summations, finite differences,
etc. Problem 1.33(b) seems a little more difficult than a
typical [2+] problem so has a weight w(2++)=4. There is a 20%
penalty for solving 1.33(b) using linear
algebra.</p>

<p> <b>Problem Set 2 (due 8 March 2017)</b> Turn in your "best" four problems from
1.38, 1.44, 1.53, 1.54 (answer should not involve summations), 1.84, 1.87, A6, A8, A10, A11.
</p>

<p> <b>Problem Set 3 (due 3 April 2017)</b> Turn in your "best" four problems from
1.47(a,b)[counts as one problem], 1.108(b), 1.113, 1.132, 1.138, 2.25, 2.26,
A4, A7. </p>

<p> Problem Set 4 (due 1 May 2017) Turn in your "best" three problems from
A9, A17, A30, A31, A32, A33.
