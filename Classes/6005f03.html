<h4> NEW: <a href=grfeedback.pdf> Giving and Receiving Feedback Handout </a>

<h3>Class Information</h3>

<p> <i> COURSE DESCRIPTION: </i> Theory, methodology, and practical
experience in the teaching of mathematics and computer science at the
university level. Includes discussion of lecturing techniques, analysis
of tests and supporting material, preparation and grading of
examinations, and related topics. Required of departmental teaching
associates.


<p><i> LEARNING GOALS: </i> The major goal is to gain the meta skills
necessary to improve your teaching of mathematics and CS.  Instead of
merely helping you improve during the seminar, we hope you come away
from this seminar with skills that will allow you to improve faster.
Specifically: 

<ul>
<li> Learn to create and obtain traces of your classroom practice;

<li> Learn how to give and receive feedback in a contructive and
non-threatening manner;

<li> Learn to persevere on in difficult situations and use resources (books,
  internet, colleagues) effectively;

<li> Learn the nuts of bolts of teaching in a university setting. 

</ul>


<p><i> COORDINATES:  </i>  Classes meet Wed 2:40--3:50 in
North Science 336.  </p>

<p> <i> TEXT: </i> <b>(1) </b>W.J. McKeachie et al.<i> McKeachie's Teaching Tips </i> Houghton-Mifflin, 2002.
</p>

<p><i> WEB RESOURCES: </i> This course has a blackboard homepage.  with a
discussion forum that We strongly encourage you to use.  Your
participation grade will be partly based on the number of useful
messages you contribute.  Go to blackboard at <a href=http://bb3.csuhayward.edu/>
http://bb3.csuhayward.edu/</a> For help with blackboard email the ICS Help
Desk at <a href=mailto:helpdesk@csuhayward.edu> helpdesk@csuhayward.edu
</a> or call them at (510) 885-HELP.

</i> http://seki.csuhayward.edu/6005.html
will be my Math/CS 6005 homepage.  It will include a copy of the syllabus
and list of homework assignments. We will keep this updated throughout
the quarter.  </p>

<p> <i> ATTENDANCE:</i>  Those who have an excused reason for missing class may
substitute either a (1) two page paper on the topic of the week or (b)
attend a Faculty Development Workshop.  Anyone who has more than 3
unexcused absences will not receive credit for the class.


<p><i> GRADING:</i> Your grade will be based largely on your written
work, mostly short papers that create traces of your teaching or that of
others. We also expect you to keep a porfolio (see below) of this course
and your current class.  Attendance and participation will also count.
Anyone with more than 3 unexcused absences will not receive credit for
the course.  There will be no exams.  </p>

<p> <i> ACADEMIC DISHONESTY: </i> Plagiarism or academic dishonesty will
result in a zero on the assignment and the submission of an Academic
Dishonesty Report.  (For a definition, see
http://www.csuhayward.edu/ecat/20032004/i-120grading.html or the
Catalog.)

<p><i> LEARNING: </i> <b> The only way to learn to teach is by doing
it! </b>  Complete each 
assignment to the best of your ability, and get help when you are confused.
Come to class prepared with questions.  Don't hesitate to seek feedback
and help from others.  Sometimes the point of view of someone who has
recently experienced something similar can be the most helpful. </p>

<p> <i> DISABILITIES </i> If you have a documented disability and wish
to discuss academic accommodations, or if you would need assistance in
the event of an emergency, please contact me as soon as possible. </p>

<p><i> PARTICIPATION: </i> We expect you to generally show up prepared
for class and willing to work.  </p>

<p><i> PORTFOLIO:  </i> Please organize your work neatly in some sort of
binder (e.g., 3-ring), so that you can refer to all your classnotes,
homework assignments, and other traces you collect about your teaching.  
reading.  We will check them at the end of the term. This will not only
help you during the class, but also later when you want to recall
something you learned but can't quite remember.  </p>
