<h3>Class Information</h3>

<p><i> LEARNING GOALS: </i> This course has an importance that goes
beyond the content.  Most students, even some math majors, think of
mathematics as learning procedures and practicing them.  It's easy for
teachers and students to fall into this habit.  Instead I want all
students to develop the mathematical habits of thought that are
necessary for doing and teaching mathematics.  Specifically:

<ul>
<li> Learn to experiment with examples, make conjectures, construct rigorous
 proofs and disproofs.  

<li> Learn to persevere on hard problems and use resources (books,
  internet, colleagues) effectively.  

<li>  Experience mathematics as a dynamic human activity, rather than a set
  of unwavering recipes handed down on stone tablets.
</ul> </p>

<p> <b> You may well initially find the unusual style of this course
challenging and even frustrating. By persevering, you will gain
mathematical maturity and develop resources that will be useful to you
in the future, whatever path your career takes.  Don't be shy about
seeking help from me, your peers, or other resources if you need it!
</b> </p>

<p><i> CONTENT GOALS: </i> </p>

<ul> 
<li> Learn to do arithmetic and high school algebra in various mods
including to
<ol>
<li> add, subtract, multiply, divide, invert, take powers
<li> solve linear equations in one variable (mod <i>m</i>) 
<li> solve systems of linear equations in one variable (mod <i>m</i>) 
<li> solve quadratic equations (mod <i>m</i>) 
<li> solve some higher power polynomial equations (mod <i>m</i>)
<li> know under what conditions the above equations will have
        solutions and whether they will be unique or multiple. 
<li> Take powers and logarithms (mod <i>p</i>) and use them to solve
        equations.  
</ol>
<li> Gain a deeper understanding of the arithmetic of the integers
  including:
<ol>
<li>the division algorithm and Euclid's algorithm
<li>solving linear diophantine equations
<li>divisibility properties and divsibility tests
<li>prime numbers and the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic
<li>number theoretic functions: tau, sigma, phi   
</ol>
</ul>

<p><i> WEB RESOURCES: </i> This course has a blackboard homepage.  with three
discussion forums that I strongly encourage you to use.  Your
participation grade will be partly based on the number of useful
messages you contribute.  Go to blackboard at <a
href=http://bb3.csuhayward.edu/> 
http://bb3.csuhayward.edu/</a> For help with blackboard email the ICS Help
Desk at <a href=mailto:helpdesk@csuhayward.edu> helpdesk@csuhayward.edu
</a> or call them at (510) 885-HELP.

</i> The homepage for this course is <a
href="http://seki.csuhayward.edu/3600.html">
http://seki.csuhayward.edu/3600.html.</a> It will include a copy of the
syllabus and list of homework assignments. I will keep this updated
throughout the quarter.  </p>


<p><i> GRADING:</i>  Your grade will be based on two exams, 
homework, participation and a portfolio of your work.  </p>

<p> The breakdown of points is: <br> <br>

<center>
<TABLE BORDER="4" CELLPADDING="2">
<tr><th> Midterm  <th> Final <th>  Homework <th> Participation
<th> Portfolio <br> 
<tr><th>25% <th>25% <th>20% <th>20% <th>10% <br> 
</TABLE>
</center>
</p>

<p><i> LEARNING: </i> <b> The only way to learn mathematics is by doing
it! </b>  Complete each 
assignment to the best of your ability, and get help when you are confused.
Come to class prepared with questions.  Don't hesitate to seek help from
other students.  Sometimes the point of view of someone who has just figured
something out can be the most helpful. </p>

<p> <i> DISABILITIES </i> If you have a documented disability and wish
to discuss academic accommodations, or if you would need assistance in
the event of an emergency, please contact me as soon as possible. </p>


<p> <i> HOMEWORK: </i> <a href="3600hw.pdf"> Homework</a> will be given for each lecture, and all the
homework assigned the previous week will be due the following Thursday.  
Please attempt all the problems by Tuesday, so that you can ask any
questions you may have in class then.  Except for routine computations,
you should always give reasons to support your work and explain what
you're doing.  Not all the problems will be graded, but only a 
subset.  Please write your solutions carefully. </p>

<p> The homework is meant to be challenging and somewhat open ended.
You may find yourself spending lots of time working on them and
sometimes getting frustrated.  This is natural.  I encourage you to work
with other people in person and using blackboard.  It's OK to get
significant help from any resource, but in the end, please write your
own solution in your own words.  <bf> Copying someone else's work
without credit is plagiarism and will be dealt with according to
<a href="http://www.csuhayward.edu/ecat/20032004/i-120grading.html#section12">
university policy.</a></bf> It also is a poor learning strategy.
