<h3> HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENTS and WRITEUPS </h3><p>

All homework assignments are from the text by O'Daffer and Clemens.  
Each is due on Wednesday of the week following the week it was
assigned. After the problems to turn in, I've listed some Practice
problems which you should do, but not hand in.  If you have questions
about any homework, feel free to ask in class.  <br>

In addition to the homework assignments, you will be assigned to write up
"Problem Reports" on some of the group activities from class.  Please do
so according to the guidelines I handed out.  <br>
