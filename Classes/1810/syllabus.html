{\it Title:} Math for Business \& Social Sciences I

{\it Coordinates:}  Lectures meet MWF 9:20--10:30 (\S 1 \#10090) and
MWF 10:40--11:50 (\S 2 \#10092) in AE 378.  

{\it Instructor:} Tom Roby; WA~783, 885-2691, {\tt
troby@mcs.csuhayward.edu }.

{\it Office Hours:} Mon. 2:45--4:25, Wed. 8:15--9:05, Wed. 12:00--12:30,
and by appointment.  I encourage you to come to scheduled office hours
if possible.  I'm happy to answer questions by email, which I check
frequently.  

{\it Text:}  J. C. Arya and R. W. Lardner: {\it Mathematical Analysis, 4th edition}.  

{\it Web resource:}  {\tt http://www.mcs.csuhayward.edu/\~{}troby/1810} will be my Math~1810
homepage.  It will include a copy of the syllabus and list of homework
assignments.  
%Check it out as soon as possible and send me your answers to the 
%{\tt Questionnaire} link.  (This is listed as a homework assignment for the
%first lecture.)  You'll also find a copy of the syllabus here in case you lose
%yours.  

{\it Grading:} There will be homework assignments, two midterm exams
given in class and a final.  There are two grading schemes.  In the
first the final exam counts 40\% and the best two grades among your
midterm and homework count for 30\% each.  In the second your grade on
the final counts 100\%.  You will automatically receive the higher of
the two grades given by these schemes, but {\bf no makeup exams will be
given.} Doing your homework well is insurance against missing an exam
because of illness or some other reason.

{\it Homework:} Homework will be given for each lecture, and all the
homework assigned the previous week will be due the following
Wednesday. Except for routine computations, you should always give
reasons to support your work and explain what you're doing.  Not all the
problems will be graded, but only a small subset; most of the ones
assigned have answers in the back so you can tell if you're on the right
track.  This makes it more important that you write your solutions
carefully.  

{\bf The only way to learn mathematics is by doing it!}  Complete each
assignment to the best of your ability, and get help when you are
confused.  Come to class prepared with questions, and don't hesitate to
seek help from other students.  Sometimes the point of view of someone
who has just figured something out can be the most helpful.  

{\it Midterm Exams:} Wed. 10/22 and Wed. 11/19.  

{\it Final Exam:} \S~1: Wed. 12/10 9:00--10:50.  \S~2: Mon. 12/8 11:00--12:50.
