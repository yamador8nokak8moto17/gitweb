<p> Here are some suggested topics for Math 6155 projects.  Feel free to
go to the library and seek other topics you might find interesting.  You
can look in old issues of the <i> American Mathematical
Monthly </i>, some of the books on or off reserve, or research journals
such as <i> Journal of Combinatorial Theory (JCT) A </i> and <i> B </i>,
<i> Discrete Mathematics </i>, or <i> Journal of Algebraic Combinatorics
</i>.  </p>

<p> I have put several books on reserve for the course, but if you have
trouble finding anything, just let me know.  I have my own copies of
most of these resources. Please don't take things out of the library for
very long until topics have been choosen, so everyone gets a chance to
look at the resources.  </p>

<ul>
<li> <b> Mathematics of Juggling </b>  Juggling patterns can be
classified by certain integer sequences.  The place to start is an
article by J. Buhler, R. Graham, et. al in the <i> American Mathematical
Monthly </i> January, 1996.  There are computer programs to demonstrate
some of these patterns.  You could juggle at your presentation!

<li> <b> Partially ordered Sets and Dilworth's Theorem </b> Dilworth's
theorem says that a poset can be partitioned into <i> n </i> chains,
where <i> n </i> is the size of the maximal antichain.  It has many
interesting applications.  See <i> The Dilworth Theorems </i> on
reserve. 
<li> <b> Distributive Lattices and Birkhoff's Theorem </b> Birkhoff's
Theorem characterizes distributive lattices in a nice way.  There are
lots of interesting examples.  One might start at chapter 3 of <i>
Enumerative Combinatorics, vol. 1 </i> by Richard Stanley.  

<li> <b> Moebius functions on partially ordered sets </b> The moebius
function is an extremely useful generalization of the notion of
inclusion-exclusion.  One might start at chapter 3 of <i>
Enumerative Combinatorics, vol. 1 </i> by Richard Stanley, or the books
of Aigner, Bogart, etc.  

<li> <b> Graph Coloring and chromatic polynomials </b> Most
combinatorics books treat graph colorings at an elementary level, but
there's some interesting recent work as well.  See me for references. 
<li> <b> Coding Theory </b> Many elementary books on combinatorics have
some information on coding theory, and there are specialized books as
well.  The hard part here will be to find material that's good to
present, without just copying what's already been done.  One might cover
Hadamard Matrices, Reed-Mueller Codes, Hamming schemes, etc.  Van Lint &
Wilson is a good place to start.  
<li> <b> Sperner's Theorem and variations </b> See Van Lint &
Wilson. 

<li> <b> Rook polynomials </b> A permutation may be viewed as a
placement of nontaking rooks on a chessboard.  What happens if some of
the squares are disallowed?  See Bryant, Van Lint & Wilson, Stanley, etc.

<li> <b> Stable Marriage Theorem </b> How to assign 2n eligible folks
into n couples in such a way that no separated pair would rather be
together than in their current configuration.  (One of the pair might,
but then the other wouldn't.)  This has applications in the
intern-matching program used to assign graduates of medical schools to
hospitals.  There are a couple of books on this in the library, by Knuth
and Gusfield.
  
<li> <b> Using computer algebra to prove identities </b> There's a
wonderful book called <i> A=B </i>, but the library doesn't have it.
See me if you're interested. 

<li> <b> Other topics in </b> van Lint & Wilson's <i> A course in
Combinatorics </i> This book has a wealth of interesting material, and
references to further information.  It's on reserve.
