<h3>Class Information</h3>

<p class="mathpar"><i> COORDINATES:  </i>  Classes meet usually Wed.
(occasionally Mon.) 5:30-6:30 in MSB 319. The registrar calls these Sec.
001, #7751 (Math 200) or Sec. 2, #7487 (Math 201W). </p> 

<p class="mathpar"><i> PREREQUISITES:  </i> Math 210 (or 220,230 or 245)
and Math 211 (or 221 or 246).  Open to sophomores or higher.  </p>

<p class="mathpar"> <i> TEXT:</i> There is no textbook for this class.  You
may find useful some of the web resources listed below.</p>

<p class="mathpar"><i> WEB RESOURCES: </i> The homepage for this course is <a
href="http://www.math.uconn.edu/~troby/Math200S08/">
http://www.math.uconn.edu/~troby/Math200S08/</a>. </p>

<p class="mathpar"><i> GRADING:</i>  Your grade will be based on
your paper; you must also attend a minimum of seven mathclub talks to
receive credit.</p>

<p class="mathpar"><i> PURPOSE: </i> This purpose of Math 200-201 is
to learn how to research and write a technical paper in mathematics.  In
each of these classes you will write a paper at least 7.5 pages long
(single-spaced, 1in. margins, font size no larger than 12pt).  
</ul>

<p class="mathpar"><i> SCHEDULE: </i> You are required to attend at
least seven of the <a
href="http://www.math.uconn.edu/MathClub/math_club.php">mathclub
talks</a> over the course of the semester.  You will write your paper
based on one of these according to the following schedule.  The
intermediate deadlines for Math 201 are offset one week from those for
Math 200, in order to spread out my workload.

<ul>
<li> Make an appointment to meet with me for twenty minutes sometime
within the first three weeks of the term;</li>
<li> Hand in an outline of your talk by Wed. Mar 19 (Math 200); Mar 26th
(Math 201);</li>
<li> Hand in a first draft to me by Wed. Apr 2 (Math 200); Apr. 9th (Math 201);</li>
<li> Final papers are due Fri 5/2 (Last day of classes). </li>
</ul>

<p class="mathpar"> <i> DISABILITIES </i> If you have a documented
disability and wish to discuss academic accommodations, or if you would
need assistance in the event of an emergency, please contact me as soon
as possible. </p>

<span class="mathtitle">Frequently Asked Questions</span><br>
<br>

<ul>

<li class="very_fluffy_li"><span class="faqq">  Which lecture should I write about?
</span><br>  Write about one of the lectures whose topic you find interesting. 
Because of your time constraints, it helps to write about one of
the earlier lectures. If you're having trouble picking a topic,
please come see me. </li>
<li class="very_fluffy_li"><span class="faqq"> Do I have to attend
lectures other than the one I'm writing about?
</span><br>  Yes, you <b>MUST</b> attend at least 7 of the lectures. Make sure you
write your name on the sign-up sheet circulated at the lecture. Coming
late or leaving early counts as at least half an absence.</li>
<li class="very_fluffy_li"><span class="faqq"> Do I have to write about
the exact topic of the lecture? 
</span><br>  No, you can write about something tangentially related. For
instance, a lecture about surface geometry may only mention geodesics
(these are locally length-minimizing paths), and their mention gives you
license to write an entire eight page paper about them. </li>
<li class="very_fluffy_li"><span class="faqq"> <b>Does this paper need to have math in it?
</span><br>  Absolutely, yes. Your paper must include technical mathematics.
Explain at least one general result and give several examples.  Define
your terms carefully.</b> </li>
<li class="very_fluffy_li"><span class="faqq">  How much explanation should my paper give?
</span><br>  Try handing the paper to a friend interested in math
who doesn't specifically know the subject you're writing about. This person should be able to
read and understand your paper.  </li>
<li class="very_fluffy_li"><span class="faqq"> What is a good place to look for references?
</span><br>  Try looking at the library,
 <a href="http://www.ams.org/mathscinet">MathSciNet</a>,
 <a href="http://www.jstor.org/">JSTOR</a>,
 <a href="http://arxiv.org">arXiv</a>,
 <a href="http://scholar.google.com">Google Scholar</a>,
 or ask <A HREF="mailto:teplyaev@math.uconn.edu">me</a>, other faculty, students, or a librarian.
 </li>
<li class="very_fluffy_li"><span class="faqq"> What format should I use?
</span><br> The main text must be typeset, rather than handwritten, even
if you have nice handwriting. You can use any
word processing or typesetting program you wish; however, modern mathematical
writing is mostly done in various dialects of very high-quality
typesetting program called TeX, especially LaTeX.   (Pronunciation of
this name is the subject of some discussion.) There are some links above
to latex guides, writing style guides, and a LaTeX template. </li>
</ul>

Let me know if you have further questions.
