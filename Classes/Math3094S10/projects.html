<h3>Project  Information</h3>

<p><i> GENERAL DESCRIPTION:</i>  The project consists of two parts: a
written paper of 6-10 pages (single spaced), and a 20-minute
presentation, with 5 minutes for questions. </p>

<p><i> PAPER:</i> The paper should be clearly written and
comprehensible by the other students in the class.  The final version
will be due the last day of class; a good first draft is due on 6 April
2010.  I will read this and suggest revisions for you to implement in
the final version. The  paper must be typeset, and I encourage you to
try using LaTeX (or plain TeX if you're a real hacker) to typeset it. 

<p> A good paper will include: motivating background information, clear
definitions, interesting examples, one or two main results, and some
nontrivial proofs.  Pictures and diagrams are welcome, as is historical
information, but not to the exclusion of some serious math.</p>

<p> <i>SCHEDULE:</i> 
<ul>
<li> Topic choices due by 2/16 (T)
<li> Outline due by 3/5 (F)
<li> First draft due by 3/30 (T)
<li> Practice talk to other students at least 4 days before presentation
<li> Practice talk to me at least 2 days before presentation
</ul>

<p> <i> TOPICS:</i> There are many interesting and accessible topics in
cryptography.  Here is a (still short) list of possibilities.  If you find one
interesting, first see what you can find out on the web about it,
including pointers to books and math papers.  I'll also be happy to
guide you to accessible places, but would like to see what you're able
to find on your own.  (I expect to learn quite a bit!)
<ul>
<li> Electronic (digital) cash
<li> Elliptic Curve techniques
<li> Lattice Methods
<li> Quantum Cryptography
<li> Zero-Knowledge Techniques
<li> Digital Cash
<li> Braid Group Cryptography 
<li> NTRUEncryp

</ul>


<p> <i> PRESENTATION:</i>  The presentation should last 20 minutes
(which is both shorter and longer than it first seems).  Rather than
reading your paper, you need to think about how to present the material
most effectively in an oral presentation.  Technical details and
detailed proofs should be avoided in favor of giving listeners a feel
for the subject and why they should find it interesting.  This is not a
license for sloppy statements, but if you need to be vague about
something too technical to present in a short amount of time, 'fess up.</p>

<ul>
<li> Atif R: NTRU encryption
<li> Briana H: DRM and stream ciphers
<li> Christine M: Elliptic curve crypto
<li> Jakob L: Quantum Cryptography
<li> Jon Y: Braid Group Cryptography
<li> Michael I: Braid Group or Zero-Knowledge
<li> Nikhaar G: NTRU encryption
<li> Tiff C: Quantum Cryptography
<li> Yevhen R: Zero-Knowledge Tehcniques or Electronic Cash
</ul>

<p> You should probably use some sort of projector, either overhead
transparencies or from a laptop, although writing on the blackboard
might be appropriate instead.  Examples and visuals are great, as are
props (if appropriate).  Handouts can be helpful to many, and can give
you a place to put technical details or long-winded statements that you
don't want to take the time to write down.</p>

<p> Everyone must practice their presentation in front of other students
(not necessarily from Math 3094) and get feedback from them.  The
presenter should keep track of this feedback and forward it to me
afterwards.  Afterwards, the presentor will practice it again for me in
my office and get feedback from me. This will make your final
presentation to the entire class much more polished than if it were your
first time.</p>

<p> Since giving and receiving feedback is a skill that benefits from
explicit teaching, here is a <a href="grfeedback.pdf"> handout on
feedback</a> that everyone should read before giving (or receiving) a
practice presentation. </p>
