I am currently a tenured full professor in the <a
href="http://www.math.uconn.edu"> Department of
Mathematics</a> at the <a href="http://www.uconn.edu">University of
Connecticut</a> in Storrs (a <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2126321">
very safe place to live</a>
though <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2011/05/01/weekinreview/01safe.html?smid=fb-nytimes&WT.mc_id=WIR-SM-E-FB-SM-LIN-WTL-050111-NYT-NA&WT.mc_ev=click?src=ISMR_AP_LO_MST_FB"> others may be better</a>), where I arrived in Fall
2005.  From Fall 2005 through Fall 2012, I also directed the <a href="http://qcenter.uconn.edu/">
Quantitative Learning Center (Q Center)</a> as 50% of my appointment.  Here is a <a
href="http://www2.math.uconn.edu/~troby/acronyms.html">partial list of UConn acronyms</a> (some now obsolete) that I needed to learn
since I arrived.  How many can you name without looking?

			<h3>Research</h3>

<p>My research is in algebraic combinatorics, specifically in dynamical algebraic combinatorics,
  where we consider actions on combinatorial objects, their orbit structures, and how these
  orbits related to statistics on the objects.   <a href="https://jamespropp.org">James Propp</a> and I coined the
  term <i>homomesy</i> (Greek for "same middle") to describe the phenomenon where a statistics has the same average over
  every orbit.</p>

<p>  I'm also interested in math educational outreach
  to K-16 students and teachers, and have worked with many programs to increase engagement and
  understanding in various levels.</p>

<HR>
			<h3>History</h3>
<p>
Before coming to <a href="http://www.uconn.edu">UConn</a> I held faculty
positions in the math departments of the following academic institutions: 
<ul> 
<li> <a href="http://www.csueastbay.edu">California State University
 Hayward</a> (which changed its name to "Cal State East Bay" in January 2005);</li>
<li>  <A HREF="http://math.wisc.edu">the University of Wisconsin</A>;</li>
<li>  <A HREF="http://www.reed.edu">Reed College</A>; and</li>
<li>  <A HREF="http://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp">the University of Tokyo</A> (as a
<a href="http://www.jsps.go.jp/english/"> JSPS</a> postdoctoral fellow).</li> 
</ul> </p>

<p>
I was a student at:
<ul>
<li>  <A HREF="http://www-math.mit.edu">MIT</A>, where I earned a
Ph.D. in algebraic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorics">combinatorics</a> under <A
HREF="http://www-math.mit.edu/~rstan">Richard Stanley</A>;</li> 
<li>  <A HREF="http://www.swarthmore.edu">Swarthmore College</A>, where
  I essentially double-majored in math and 
ancient Greek;
<li> <a href="http://www.kenwoodacademy.org/">Kenwood Academy</a>, a public high school on the South side of 
Chicago;   
<li> <a href="https://www.harte.cps.edu/">Bret Harte School (Chicago)</a>; and
<li> <a href="http://www.anconaschool.org/">Ancona Montessori School
(Chicago)</a> Click <a href="http://www2.math.uconn.edu/~troby/images/ancona1.jpg"> here </a> for an
Ancona picture.  Can you pick me out?  
</ul>
Of course, my life has always been measured in academic years.  </p>

<p> Along the way I directed, taught in, and/or participated in a number
  of summer programs, including 
<ul>

<li> Faculty at <a href="https://www.mathpath.org/">MathPath</a>, for advanced students aged 10&ndash;14 with a strong
  interest in math (3 summers). 

<li> Founding and directing ACCLAIM (Alameda County Collaborative for
  Learning and Instruction in Mathematics), a large grant-funded professional
  development program for K&#8210;12 teachers (5 summers).</li>

<li> Founding head counselor, then recitation instructor at <a href="http://www.promys.org/">ProMYS (PROgram in Mathematics for Young Scientists)</a> at
<a href="http://math.bu.edu/">Boston University</a> (4 summers); 
<li>  Senior staff at <a href="http://www.hcssim.org/">HCSSiM (Hampshire
    College Summer Studies in Mathematics)</a> (2 summers);
<li>  <a href="http://www.nmhschool.org/about-nmh">Northfield
Mount Hermon Summer School</a> (1 summer); and
<li>  Student, counselor, and head counselor at <a href="http://www.math.ohio-state.edu/ross/">The
Arnold Ross math program</a>
  at <a href="http://www.math.ohio-state.edu/">Ohio State University</a>
  (5 summers).
